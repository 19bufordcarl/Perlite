# Reroll Tokens

A PC can spend a Reroll Token to reroll any [[../Game Procedures/Check|Check]] and must use the new result.

A PC can only have 1 reroll token at a time.

It is up to the referee to decide how to give out reroll tokens. 

*Author's Note:*
*Generally the design of this system assumes how I run my games. I generally let players start with one reroll token at the start of each session. I only give them additional reroll tokens on especially daring acts, maybe once every 3 or 4 sessions.*

*I like how this makes it feel like a predictable resource they can plan around somewhat rather than trying to do things they think might reroll tokens, and they are excited when they get one.*

*I think Shadowdark underestimates just how powerful reroll mechanics are once you get to higher levels. Experienced players are very savvy with which rolls matter most and they get a lot of bang for their buck out of just one reroll. I have never had a TPK, and only one player death in sessions where I used reroll tokens.*
