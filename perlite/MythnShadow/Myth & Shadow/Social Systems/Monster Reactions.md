# Monster Reactions

When encountering a monster from a random table, usually when [[../Game Procedures/Delving\|Delving]] or during an [[../Game Procedures/Overland Journeys\|Overland Journey]], if the monster would not clearly be hostile, then you can roll for its reaction.
- Undead would clearly be hostile for example.

The encountering PC may add their [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Charisma\|Charisma]] to the 2d6 roll.

| 2d6        | Reaction                             |

| 7-9        | Wary: Might attack if provoked       |
| 10         | Neutral: Ignores the PCs             |
| 11         | Cordial: Willing to talk / negotiate |
