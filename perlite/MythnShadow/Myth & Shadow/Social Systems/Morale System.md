# Morale

Morale is the system to handle when NPCs will attempt to flee or surrender. 

## Enemy Morale
When a breaking point occurs, the referee makes a [[../Game Procedures/DC\|DC]] 15 + [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Wisdom|Wisdom]] [[../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]] for the creature / creature's leader. On a failure, their morale is broken.

The following are considered breaking points.
- A solo monster going below half HP
- A group losing half their members or their leader

On a successful morale check the enemies will go into life preservation mode. They should first try to flee, if they deem that impossible or unlikely then they may attempt surrender. Particularly sly enemies may feign surrender until the party provides a vulnerable opening.

## NPC Hireling Morale
When the party undergoes a breaking point, if there are any non-[[Companions\|Companion]] NPCs undergo a similar breakpoint, a PC must make a [[../Game Procedures/DC\|DC]] 15 + (highest level enemy creature) [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Charisma\|Charisma]] [[../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]] or else the NPCs morale is broken. They will attempt to flee, or plead for surrender.
