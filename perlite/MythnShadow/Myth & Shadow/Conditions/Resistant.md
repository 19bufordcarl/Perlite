# Resistant

If you are resistant to a [[../Damage Types/!Damage Types\|Damage Type]], you take half damage from that damage type.

If that damage requires you to make a [[../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]], (to save against poison or disease for example) you have [[../Game Procedures/Dice Rolls/Advantage|Advantage]] on that check.
