# Alchemy

Alchemy was the foundation of magical understanding. All alchemical understanding points towards the following general recipe for successful potion brewing.
## Procedure
Potion brewing requires 
1. A sterile container, usually a glass bottle
2. Twice the [[../Mythril\|Mythril]] required to cast that spell
3. Purified water (usually through an alchemical apparatus to achieve purification) 
4. A [[../Spellcasting\|Spellcasting]] check for that spell. 
	1. Add any bonuses / penalties from your apparatus.
5. On a success, you have successfully brewed a potion of that spell! 
	1. The brewing process generally takes 1 hour succeed or fail. 
		1. A failure consumes all materials still and yields bad water.
	2. Brewing can be done while long [[../../Game Procedures/Resting\|Resting]].
6. Potions retain the ranges of their spells as follows (unless otherwise augmented). 
	1. Self: Liquid must be drunk
	2. Touch/Target: The liquid must touch the target or be drunk
	3. AOE: Explodes in the radius when the bottle is uncorked / broken


As a general rule of thumb effectively all (>99%) of the liquid in a potion must be consumed / coat the target in order for a 'critical mass' of liquid to bind the magical effect. Small tastes can give clues to the effect of a potion, without imbibing the full affect. Potions cannot be split / shared, unless of course they are AOE in which case everyone in the radius incurs the full effect. 

*Optional Rule: Harvester (Not recommended)*
*A monster part from the associated domain of that spell reduces the spellcasting check required equal to the level of the monster from which the part was harvested.* 

*Monsters have a number of harvestable parts equal to their level.*

*Only one monster part can be used per potion brewed.*

*Optional Rule: Harvester - Extreme*
*Same as the harvester variant, with the following addition.*

*Using monster parts add a random effect based on the level of the monster part. When the potion is used (not made), roll on the [[Alchemy Table]] to see what the effect is. Some are good, others bad!*
