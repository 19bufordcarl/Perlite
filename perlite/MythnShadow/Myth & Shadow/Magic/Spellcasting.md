# Spellcasting

Mortals cannot use magic innately. Magic is fickle, ancient, and poorly understood. Hence why it is called magic. Magic is channeled though [[Mythril\|Mythril]] powder or magic items.

To successfully cast the spell, you must make an [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Intelligence|Intelligence]] [[../Game Procedures/Check|Check]] for that spell.
	The [[../Game Procedures/DC|DC]] is equal to 10 + 2 x the [[Spell Levels\|Spell's Level]]. 

Casting spells uses an amount of [[Mythril]] powder correspond to the [[Spell Levels|Spell's Level]].
- You can only cast spells you have [[Spell Memorization\|Memorized]].
- Casting spells learned from a [[Spells/Patrons/Patron\|Patron]] uses the [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Ability Scores\|Ability Score]] associated with that [[Spells/Patrons/Patron\|Patron]].
- Casting from magic items uses whatever the rules of that magic item are. 
	- By default, [[Spell Scrolls]] and magic items are treated the same as [[Mythril\|Mythril]] casting.

On a failed check, the spell fizzles, any Mythril powder or other resource is still consumed.

On a critically failed check, a [[../Game Procedures/Dice Rolls/Critical Miscast|Critical Miscast]] occurs.

## Blood Magic
If you fail a spell casting check, you may choose to succeed it instead, you lose [[../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Fatigue Points\|Fatigue Points]] equal to the difference between the result of your roll and the spell's [[../Game Procedures/DC|DC]]. If this reduces your FP to 0, you take the remaining difference to your [[../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Health Points\|HP]], and then you gain the [[../Conditions/Exhausted\|Exhausted]] condition.

## Spellcasting Aesthetics
Spellcasting requires ***two free hands*** for complex hand movements. You must speak an otherworldly incantation whose sound booms with arcane energy unless otherwise noted. Spell casting takes time, specified on the spell card under “Casting”.

Spellcasting that shoots projectiles at a a target do not require a [[../Game Procedures/Ranged Attack\|Ranged Attack]] [[../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]], that is part of what the spellcasting check is doing. You still must have a clear line of sight to the target.

Remember the [[../Foreword/Rule for rules\|Rule for rules]].
