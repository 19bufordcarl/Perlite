# Spell Domains

Spell domains represent the fundamental forces of the fabric of reality that the spell is channeling. Every spell is some combination of one of the four fundamental elements. Air, Earth, Water, Fire. The most powerful spells that draw on all pieces of reality use all the elements. 

In addition to the fundamental elements, spells draw from either the energy of life from the spirit realm, or the energy of death from the void. Some spells are neutral, drawing only from the energy of the mortal realm.
