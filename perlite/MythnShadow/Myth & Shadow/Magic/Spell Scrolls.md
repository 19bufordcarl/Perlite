# Spell Scrolls

Spell scrolls are created by mages using [[Mythril]] infused ink. They are typically bound up in a spell book, but can also be loose.

The magic of the inked spell let's a sufficiently powerful mind absorb the knowledge of the spell into their being much faster than learning it again from scratch.

However, each mind has their own way of understanding and scribing a spell. 

Trying to [[Spell Memorization#Memorizing New Spells (Learning)\|learn a new spell]] from a inked page you did not write requires an [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Intelligence|Intelligence]] [[../Game Procedures/Check|Check]] of [[../Game Procedures/DC|DC]] 15 and takes 1 hour, can be done on a short [[../Game Procedures/Resting|Rest]].
	On a failure, the page disintegrates, roll on the [[Miscast Tables/!Mythril Miscast Tables|Mythril Miscast Table]].
		If [[../Game Procedures/Resting#Interruption|Interrupted]], you must stop this process to engage in combat.
		If you stop, roll on the [[Miscast Tables/!Mythril Miscast Tables|Mythril Miscast Table]].
	On a success, you learn the spell.

Alternatively, you can attempt to [[Spellcasting|Cast]] the spell scroll directly, destroying the ink.
	Make [[Spellcasting]] [[../Game Procedures/Check|Check]] as if you were casting that spell normally.
	If it is of a higher level than you max level, make that [[../Game Procedures/Check|Check]] at [[../Game Procedures/Dice Rolls/Disadvantage|Disadvantage]].

In this way a spell scroll, or spell book of scrolls can act as a kind of storage for any spells the PC comes across but does not have the mental space to memorize.
