# Patrons
Patrons are the deities of the world whom PCs can swear their faith to, following rituals to gain specified boons and banes. By default, PCs are not assumed to start with a Patron, but they may choose to be inducted into a Patron's order as a downtime activity.

A creature can only be bound to the faith of a single patron at a time.

For higher powered or themed campaigns the referee may allow a PC to start bonded to a specific Patron.

## Lore
*The deities of the world of Myth and Shadow are fickle and ancient. Their presence goes unseen by most. While no respectable scholar would outright deny their existence, there are certainly those who question their exact "divine" nature and just where the line lies between them and mortals.* 

*There are some dubious accounts of outright "miracles" being performed through the grace of a deity, but this is not well excepted by the arcane community. There is certainly a credence to the healing rituals the temples across the Empire perform for her peoples, but these rituals are studiable magicks, using standard Mythril techniques. The priests swear that their rituals and prayer teaches them how to weave the magic more effectively, and the High Imperial Archpriest may call me a heretic, but I believe this is nothing more than Mythril at work.*
