You create a 30' cube of sticky web within range. Any creatures in the affected area must make a [[../../../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Strength|Strength]] [[../../../../Game Procedures/Check|Check]] with a [[../../../../Game Procedures/DC|DC]] equal to your [[../../../Spellcasting|Spellcasting]] [[../../../../Game Procedures/Check|Check]]. On a failure, they are [[../../../../Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]. On a success, they break free. They may repeat this [[../../../../Game Procedures/Check|Check]] as an [[../../../../Game Procedures/Action|Action]].

*Upcast: Range increases by 30' per spell level.*
