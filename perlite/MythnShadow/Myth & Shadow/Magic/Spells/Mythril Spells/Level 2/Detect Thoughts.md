# Detect Thoughts

| Level    | 2 #Spell2                                          |

| Casting  | 1 [[../../../../Game Procedures/Action\|Action]]   |
| Duration | 1 hour ([[../../../Concentration\|Concentration]]) |
| Range    | 30 feet                                            |

For the duration, you gain the ability to peer into the mind of creatures you can see within range. Each [[../../../../Game Procedures/Combat|Combat]] [[../../../../Game Procedures/Round|Round]] you can learn one target's immediate thoughts. The target then makes a [[../../../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Wisdom|Wisdom]] [[../../../../Game Procedures/Check|Check]] with a [[../../../../Game Procedures/DC|DC]] equal to your last [[../../../Spellcasting|Spellcasting]] [[../../../../Game Procedures/Check|Check]]. On a success, the target notices your mental intrusion, then the spell ends. 

*Upcast: The referee can give you deeper level thoughts appropriate to the spell level.*
