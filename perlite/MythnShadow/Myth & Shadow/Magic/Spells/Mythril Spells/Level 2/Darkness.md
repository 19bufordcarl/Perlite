You create a sphere of magical darkness with a 15' radius. Creatures inside this darkness are [[../../../../Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]].

Only magical light can penetrate this darkness, and only if it came from a spell whose [[../../../Spell Levels|Level]] is greater than or equal to the [[../../../Spell Levels|Level]] used to cast [[Darkness]].

The target of the sphere can be a point, or an object.

*Upcast: Resists higher level magical light.*
