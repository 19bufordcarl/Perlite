You create illusions (images) that look exactly like you. You can create a number of images equal to half your [[../../../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Intelligence|Intelligence]] rounded down (minimum 1). Whenever you would be dealt damage, the damage hits one of your images instead, which dissipates harmlessly. 

The spell ends once all the images are gone.

*Upcast: Create an additional image per spell level.*
