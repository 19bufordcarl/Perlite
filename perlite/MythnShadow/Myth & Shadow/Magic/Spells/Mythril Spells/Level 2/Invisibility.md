##### FAQ
Dealing damage that is reduced to 0 by armor still counts as taking damage for this spell. The best theories scholars have is that invisibility works by distancing your body from the physical realm. By harming another being, your soul is forcibly reconnected to the world. The armor reduces the damage you dealt to effectively 0, but the magic is still broken.
