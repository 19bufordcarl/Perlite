You touch one creature and imbue it with the tides of fate. The next time that creature rolls a natural 1 on a [[../../../../Game Procedures/Check|Check]], they may reroll the d20 and use the new result.

A creature can only benefit from this spell once per session.

*Upcast: Range increases by 30' per spell level.*
