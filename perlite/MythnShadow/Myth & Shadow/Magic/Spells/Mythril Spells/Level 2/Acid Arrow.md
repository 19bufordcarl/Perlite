An especially corrosive bolt of acid shoots forth at a target you can see in range. It takes 2d4 [[../../../../Damage Types/Acid|Acid]] damage. Whatever damage reduction that creature has is reduced by 1.

If the damage reduction came from an [[../../../../Items/Equipment/Armor|Armor]] set, that [[../../../../Items/Equipment/Armor|Armor]] set is permanently damaged. [[../../../../Items/Equipment/Armor|Armor]] of elven quality or higher is only damaged until the acid is washed off with water.

*Upcast: Deal an additional 1d4 damage per spell level.*
