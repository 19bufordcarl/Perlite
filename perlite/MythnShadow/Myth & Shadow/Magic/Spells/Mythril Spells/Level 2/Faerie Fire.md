You create a 10 foot cube on a point you can see within range. Bright purplish pink magical dust encompasses that cube, revealing all invisible items and creatures in the cube, as well as granted [[../../../../Game Procedures/Dice Rolls/Advantage|Advantage]] on [[../../../../Game Procedures/Attack|Attacks]] against affected creatures.
