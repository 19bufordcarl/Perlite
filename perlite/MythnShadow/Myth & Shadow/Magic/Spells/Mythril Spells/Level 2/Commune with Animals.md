You can perform this ritual to touch and animal and gain the ability to perceive through the animals senses for the duration. You can also exchange thoughts with the animal. The animal uses the intelligence level of the animal, but at they can give at least rudimentary information and directions about the local environment and predators / monsters.

You must use an [[../../../../Game Procedures/Action|Action]] to switch between your senses and the animal's.
