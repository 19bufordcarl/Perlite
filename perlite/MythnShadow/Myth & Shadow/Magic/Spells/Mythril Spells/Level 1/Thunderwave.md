You clap your hands together creating a sonic blast. This concussive wave deals 1d6 + 1 [[../../../../Damage Types/Bludgeoning\|Bludgeoning]] damage to creatures within a 10 foot radius of you. Each creature must make a [[../../../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Constitution\|Constitution]] [[../../../../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]] against a [[../../../../Game Procedures/DC\|DC]] equal to your [[../../../Spellcasting\|Spellcasting]] check. On a failure the creature is pushed back 10 feet.

Any unsecured objects are flung backwards. The thunderous clap is audible for around 300 feet.

*Upcast: Deal an additional 1d6 damage per spell level.*
