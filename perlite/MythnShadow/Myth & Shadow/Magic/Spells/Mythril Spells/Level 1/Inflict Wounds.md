You reverse a basic healing ritual to disrupt the flow of life in a creature. The creature takes 2d4 + your [[../../../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Wisdom\|Wisdom]] [[../../../../Damage Types/Necrotic\|Necrotic]] damage. 

This damage cannot be [[../../../../Conditions/Resistant\|Resisted]]. ([[../../../../Conditions/Immune|Immune]] creatures are still unaffected).

*Upcast: You deal an additional 1d4 damage per spell level.*
