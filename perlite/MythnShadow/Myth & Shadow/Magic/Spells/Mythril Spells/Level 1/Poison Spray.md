You breathe out and create a toxic cloud affecting all creatures within 5 feet of you. 

Affected creatures take 1d4 [[../../../../Damage Types/Necrotic\|Necrotic]] damage and must make a [[../../../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Constitution\|Constitution]] check with a [[../../../../Game Procedures/DC\|DC]] equal to your [[../../../Spellcasting\|Spellcasting]] [[../../../../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]]. On a failure, the poison makes the creature is [[../../../../Conditions/Incapacitated\|Incapacitated]] on its next turn, which it spends coughing. After that the poison wears off.

*Upcast: Deal an additional 1 damage per spell level.*
