You place a simple curse on a creature you can see within range. Whenever it takes damage, it takes an additional 1 [[../../../../Damage Types/Necrotic|Necrotic]] damage.

This damage cannot be [[../../../../Conditions/Resistant\|Resisted]]. ([[../../../../Conditions/Immune|Immune]] creatures are still unaffected).

*Upcast: The creature takes an additional 1 damage per spell level.*
