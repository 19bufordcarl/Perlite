You can touch one object, creature, or specify a roughly 25 foot area. If a creature enters the area or touches the object, then a magical alarm (noise of your imagination) goes off in your head. You can choose creatures for this alarm to ignore as part of the casting. 

*Upcast: The area increases by 25 feet per spell level.*
