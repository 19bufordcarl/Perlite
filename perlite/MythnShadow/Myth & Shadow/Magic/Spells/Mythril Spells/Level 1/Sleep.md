You can select a number of creatures within range equal to your [[../../../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Intelligence\|Intelligence]]. Those creatures fall asleep and are [[../../../../Conditions/Unconscious\|Unconscious]] if they are level 2 or lower. Any significant physical disturbance wakes them up.

*Upcast: You can put creatures to sleep of one level higher per spell level.*
