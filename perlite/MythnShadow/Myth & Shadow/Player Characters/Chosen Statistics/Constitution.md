# Constitution

Abbreviated as **CON**

Your constitution represents your physical endurance. The following [[../../Game Procedures/Check\|Checks]] and systems use constitution.

- How many [[../Derived Statistics/Fatigue Points\|Fatigue Points]] you have
- How many [[../Derived Statistics/Health Points\|Health Points]] you have 
- Traveling long distances
- [[../../Game Procedures/Resting\|Resting]] effectively 
- Resisting physical effects (cold, disease, poison, acid, etc.)
- How heavy the [[../../Items/Equipment/Armor|Armor]] you can wear can be (with [[Strength\|Strength]])

If a creature's [[Constitution]] would be decreased below -5, including from [[../Derived Statistics/Scars|Scars]], it [[../../Conditions/Dying#Dead|Dies]].

Other use cases that fall in line with these according to referee discretion may also use **CON**
