# Item Slot

An item slot is used as the unit of abstraction of [[Carry Capacity\|Carry Weight]] for the purpose of making managing inventory streamlined and enjoyable for gameplay. 

An item slot is something that either 
	1. Weighs around 5 pounds **OR** 
	2. Is about as big as a bicycle helmet 

Smaller items of the same thing can be bundled together into 1 slot. The common examples are
	1. 2 days of rations
	2. 10 of certain [[../../Items/Equipment/Standard Gear|Gear]] (iron spikes, candles, etc.)
	3. 20 pieces of most ammunition (arrows, bolts, sling stones, etc.)
	4. 500 [[../../Referee Specific/Economy/Coins\|Coins]] 
		1. (Number of slots rounds down, so 0-500 takes up 0 slots)
	5. 500 coins worth of [[../../Magic/Mythril\|Mythril]] powder 
		1. (Number of slots rounds down, so 0-500 takes up 0 slots)

The goal of the system is to preserve verisimilitude of how much stuff PCs can reasonably have on them, as well as provide opportunities for decisions with clear costs. Example: Do I carry an additional torch into the dungeon or a shield?
