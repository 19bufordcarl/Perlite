# Armor Class (aka Attack Class)

A creatures Armor Class or Attack Class (AC) represents how hard it is to hit that creature. AC is a particular type of [[../../Game Procedures/DC\|DC]] used for attack checks. An attack [[../../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]] must meet or beat a targets AC to deal damage. A failure is considered a miss, and deals no damage.

A creature's AC is equal to **twice** their [[../Chosen Statistics/Dexterity\|Dexterity]].

While a creatures AC could in theory be negative, the fact that a natural 1 is a [[../../Game Procedures/Dice Rolls/Critical Miss|Critical Miss]] means that it is always possible for an attack to miss.



*Authorâ€™s Note:*
*AC is unrelated to [[../../Items/Equipment/Armor|Armor]] the item, [[../../Items/Equipment/Armor|Armor]] reduces physical damage.*

*A player's armor class is kept as this name for the historical purpose of AC being recognizable as the number you roll on the d20 to "hit".*

*The name attack class can be used as it is more accurate, either way it abbreviates to AC.*
