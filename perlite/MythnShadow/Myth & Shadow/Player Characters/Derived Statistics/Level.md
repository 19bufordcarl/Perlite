# Level

Your level starts at 1 and increases whenever you reach the threshold [[Experience Points\|Experience Points]].

When you level up, you can increase 3 different [[../Chosen Statistics/Ability Scores\|Ability Scores]] by 1 each, or 1 ability score by 2.
	Don't forget to adjust any relevant derived statistics.

## Creature's Level
NPCs and monsters also have levels, but they are defined in the referee specific section.
