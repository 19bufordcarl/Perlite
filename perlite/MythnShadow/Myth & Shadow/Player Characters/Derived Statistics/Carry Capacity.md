# Carry Capacity

This game uses an [[Item Slots|Item Slot]] system (think Minecraft). An item slot is an abstracted unit of weight / space combined for ease of inventory management. 

A PC with an [[../../Items/Equipment/Adventurer's Pack|Adventurer's Pack]] has 10 [[Item Slots\|Item Slots]]. 

An item slot is something that 
	1. Weighs about 5 pounds **OR** 
	2. Is about as big as a bicycle helmet 

If a PC wishes to carry more than can fit in their pack, then they can get a cart, wagon, horse, or similar item. See [[../../Items/Equipment/Standard Gear|Standard Gear]]. 

While a PC is [[../../Game Procedures/Delving\|Delving]], they can choose to put their weapons and shield away to carry a single box-like item (or a hand cart) of weight less than 50 + (25 * [[../Chosen Statistics/Strength\|Strength]]). While carrying this box, you considered surprised for all [[../../Game Procedures/Initiative\|Initiative]] rolls.
- If this box is less than half your carry weight, 
	- then you can carry the box indefinitely. (So you could [[../../Game Procedures/Overland Journeys\|Overland Journey]] with it).
- If the box if greater than half your carry weight, 
	- then you can carry this box for a number of delve [[../../Game Procedures/Round\|Rounds]] equal to twice your [[../Chosen Statistics/Constitution\|Constitution]].

Worn items such as clothing and [[../../Items/Equipment/Armor|Armor]] do not take up any slots. [[../../Items/Equipment/Weapons|Weapons]] and ammo do.
	The sheathes for your weapons and quivers for your ammo become part of your pack.
