### Tox'ra [[Ancestry\|Ancestry]]
*The Lizardfolk refer to themselves as Tox'ra, or 'Of the Tree'. They have an unfortunate plight in a world dominated by mammalian creatures. Their strange and alien appearance has led them to be treated like beasts and monsters by many. They are from the Xar’lith jungle, a place poorly documented by imperial scribes with legends of gigantic lizards larger than a windmill.* 

*Few Non-Lizardfolk have been to Xar’lith. Many people view the Lizardfolk as strange, alien and treat them with hesitation. The more learned folk might have more nuanced opinions, save for the [[Infernals\|Infernals]], who have stolen countless Lizardfolk from their homes as slaves. Lizardfolk are distrusting of the Empire and outsiders given the violence they have received.*

*Lizardfolk culture is much more gender fluid and less hierarchical than the rest of the Imperial cultures. In the pockets of Lizardfolk civilization that remain, such as Krik’ras, they are highly egalitarian and value freedom and self determination.*
