# Backgrounds

Your background represents what your character did prior to becoming an adventurer.

Table taken from Shadowdark and changed slightly.

Your background knowledge and skills might prove useful during your adventures. 
	You can make an informed request to the referee if you think your background should grant you [[../Game Procedures/Dice Rolls/Advantage|Advantage]] when you would make a [[../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]]. The referee decides the exact boon (if any).

Feel free to choose manually, roll, or make a custom background with your referee’s blessing.
