# Movement

On a turn in combat, you can move up to your speed (default 30’). On a grid, each square is usually 5', so this would be 6 squares. In a measurement system 5ft would be 1in, so this would be 6 inches. Movement can be broken up into multiple pieces, like (move attack move).

## Difficult Movement
Difficult movement costs double your movement resource. Examples include:
- Crawling
- Sneaking
- Wading
- Swimming
- Difficult Terrain
- Climbing
## Movement Minor Actions
You can use 5 feet of movement to perform minor actions. The most used examples being:
- Drink a potion (max of 1 per [[Round\|Round]])
- Stand up
- Open a door
- Lie down / Crouch
- Pull a lever
- Pick up an item

## Opportunity Attacks
If you are [[../Conditions/Threatened\|Threatened]] by a creature, moving out of that creature’s threaten range allows that creature to use its [[Reaction\|Reaction]] to make a [[Melee Attack\|Melee Attack]] against you.
	These are called opportunity attacks.

You may sacrifice 15 feet of movement this turn to not provoke opportunity attacks.

## Enemy Creatures
You cannot move through a space occupied by another creature who is unwilling to let you pass. If that creature is [[../Conditions/Incapacitated\|Incapacitated]] or [[../Conditions/Prone\|Prone]] you may move through its space.

## Sizes
Creatures occupy a space equal to their size. Normal size is 1 square or 5 feet. For creatures 2 sizes larger than you, (3 squares or more for normal size) you move through their space with [[Movement#Difficult Movement\|Difficult Movement]]. If you end your [[Turn]] in their occupied space, they may use their [[Reaction]] to make an [[Movement#Opportunity Attacks\|Opportunity Attack]] against you.

*Optional Rule: Variable Speed*
*PCs have a base move speed of 30 feet. 
Each point of [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] increases (or decreases) a PCs speed by 5’. 
Each point of strength a PCs worn [[../Items/Equipment/Armor|Armor]] requires (not shields) decreases their speed by 5’.*

*Good for gamers who enjoy the nitty gritty of positioning tactics on battle maps.*
