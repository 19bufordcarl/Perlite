# Reaction

A reaction can be taken at any time during combat when no [[Action\|Action]] is occurring.

You can only take one reaction per round.
	Imagine you have a reaction point. You gain it on your turn, use it or lose it.

The most common reaction is readying an [[Action\|Action]].

Another common reaction is [[../Items/Equipment/Armor|Shield Block]].

Unless you ready them, only specified abilities and spells can be used as a reaction.
