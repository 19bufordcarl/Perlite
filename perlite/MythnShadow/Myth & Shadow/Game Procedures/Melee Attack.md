# Melee Attack

To make a melee attack, you make a [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Strength\|Strength]] [[Check\|Check]] and compare the result to the target's [[../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Armor Class\|Armor Class]], generally equal to the target's [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Dexterity\|Dexterity]]. On a success, you roll damage die according to whatever [[../Items/Equipment/Weapons|Weapon]] you used to make the attack, and add your [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Strength\|Strength]] to get the final damage.

Melee attacks have a range of 5â€™ (adjacent square on a grid) unless stated otherwise.

Unarmed attacks such as Fists or Claws deal 1 + [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Strength\|Strength]] damage unless otherwise noted.
