# Turn

A "turn" is simply one players turn to act. On a turn you may perform an [[Action\|Action]] and [[Movement\|Movement]].

In [[Combat\|Combat]], turns last 6 seconds and have relatively strict rules for what you can do.

In combat, things that require very little time or effort are called a free action. These can be done at will on your turn within reason. The main example is talking. You can talk in character during your turn with allies or the enemy and it doesn't cost you anything.
	Try to keep it to a reasonable amount of time to keep the game moving and let other players have their turn.
	Other examples include dropping what you are holding, dropping concentration, etc.

When [[Delving\|Delving]], a turn last 6 minutes and actions have much more lee way.
