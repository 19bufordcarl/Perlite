# Difficulty Class

The Difficulty Class (DC) represents the number that needs to be rolled on a given [[Check\|Check]] for it to be successful. 

A DC should rarely require the natural dice result to be lower than 5 or higher than 18.
## Default DCs
- 10 for easy checks
- 15 for normal checks
- 20 for hard checks
- 25 for extreme checks 
## Rare DCs
- 5 is too low usually.
	- It should only be used for very easy checks for PCs with a terrible relevant ability.
	- If a player can only fail on a natural 1, consider ruling guaranteed success.
- 30 is nearly impossible, until much higher levels.
	- It should only be used for the *nearly* impossible.
	- If a player can only succeed on a natural 20, consider ruling guaranteed fail.

For things where there is no time pressure, the referee can also use the PCs ability score as is without a roll to decide whether they can do the action if randomness does not make sense.

*Author's Note:*
*While the referee can set any DC they want, it is important to remember they are not a computer and cannot take in all aspects of the situation. Perfect is the enemy of good enough. The main 3 DCs of 10, 15, 20 serve me well for almost all checks. I rarely stray from them.*
