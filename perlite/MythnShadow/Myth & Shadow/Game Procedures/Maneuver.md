# Maneuver

Maneuver's represent a catch all for [[Action|Actions]] that a creature wishes to take that is not defined elsewhere in the rules. The rules for resolving maneuvers are as follows.

## When can a creature perform a maneuver?
- A creature can perform a maneuver whenever they *could* do damage to an enemy.
	- [[Melee Attack]], [[Ranged Attack]], etc.
		- [[../Magic/Spellcasting|Spellcasting]] / [[../Magic/Alchemy/Alchemy|Alchemy]] generally cannot do maneuvers, the spell does what it does. It's too confusing to still have the spell use a resource but not take effect.
	- Attempts to shackle someone and similar count, provided you have a weapon handy.
- A creature can describe the maneuver they wish to perform at any time on their [[Turn]] before the damage from that attack is applied to the creature
	- Before the attack / spell check, after that check, before damage rolled, after damage is rolled, etc. So long as it is before the referee applies the damage 
		- "Applying damage" means once the referee gives the PCs otherwise hidden information about the consequences of that damage 
			- It kills them, causes them to check [[../Social Systems/Morale System|Morale]], etc.
- ~~A creature can only perform 1 maneuver per minute (10 combat [[Round|Rounds]]).~~
	- ~~Generally this means you can only do this once per combat.~~
		- ~~Maneuvers can be done outside of / before combat however.~~
	- ~~This prevents the combats going to slow. Because otherwise it would in theory be strictly optimal to always attempt a maneuver and hope you mentally exhaust the referee enough that they make some incorrect choices.~~
		- ~~#TODO test whether or not this is true in practice.~~
		- ~~#TODO should be possible to get more maneuvers? Boss monsters, higher levels?~~
## How are maneuver's resolved?
The 'attacker' proposes the maneuver / effect they would like to impose on the target ***instead*** of the damage and other effects (such as [[../Conditions/!Conditions|Conditions]]) of the attack. The target chooses whether to take the damage as normal, or suffer the effect of the maneuver.
## What kind of maneuver's can creatures do?
A creature can propose any maneuver. However, if the maneuver is clearly better than the damage rolled, the target (either the PC, or the NPC as judged by the referee) will just choose to take the damage instead.


## *Authors Note:*
#### *What is the narrative explanation?*
*This may seem strange at first, "why does my opponent get to choose how I attack them?", but it actually helps increase the verisimilitude and engagement in combat once applied properly.*

*Suppose there is a PC fighting with a zombie. They propose a maneuver to wrap a towel around the zombies mouth preventing it from biting unless they beat their attack [[Check]] with a [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Strength|Strength]] [[Check]] to rip off the towel. This leaves the zombie unable to attack, which is quite strong. The thief only rolled 3 damage on their attack and so the referee thinks, 'the zombie is going do everything it can to avoid this, so that's not happening' and says "it just takes the 3 damage." But the referee can narrate it as such. "You lunge at the zombie with your towel trying to smother it, but it lunges back at you. You manage to avoid it's decaying jaws and get in a quick slash with your dagger, but you missed the opportunity to wrap it in your towel."* 

*This general structure of you try to do X and either you do X, or the creature reacts in some way and you settle for Y is ideal. It avoids the "null result" of failed maneuvers, something is always happening, just maybe not exactly what you wanted.*

*This method is known affectionately in the TTRPG space as the "you cut I choose" rule. In referebce to the popular method for sharing a piece of cake: one person decides where to cut, while the other chooses their slice first. Whoever decides how to cut the cake, (the maneuver or the damage) will get the worse of the two slices usually. This encourages self interested parties to be as fair as possible, because they know that if they cut one slice clearly bigger, then they will get the smaller slice.* 

*This method also removes the hassle of needing needlessly detailed rules for maneuvers as it leverages the existing rules for damage and allows us to balance combat capabilities virtually entirely around DPR and status effects, while still letting players express creativity in combat.* 

*For referees: The referee should decide what the target would do rather than using meta knowledge about the PCs (unless the target also has that meta knowledge in which case it isn't meta, it's just knowledge). If you always use meta knowledge the PCs will rarely benefit from maneuvers assuming you are about as good at strategy as they are. Try to think what the target would choose. Don't play them stupid, but also don't choose take damage instead of a 'mediocre' maneuver because you know one of the PCs has a magic item that can 'combo' off that maneuver.*
