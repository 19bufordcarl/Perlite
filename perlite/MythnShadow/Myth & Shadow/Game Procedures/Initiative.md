# Initiative

When a combat encounter begins, you need to determine [[Turn\|Turn]] order for the [[Round\|Round]].

All the PCs make a [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] [[Check\|Check]] and the referee rolls for each enemy or uses the appropriate expected roll. Whoever rolls highest goes first. When it is the PCs turn, play passes to the left, skipping the referee until all PCs have gone. Then the referee acts for all the enemies.
	If a PC wishes to wait until another PC goes, they can use the “ready [[Action\|Action]]”.

Once all combatants have taken a turn, that round ends and the next round begins, returning to the side who won the high roll.

The initiative [[Check\|Check]] uses [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Dexterity\|Dexterity]].

*Optional Rule:*
*You can have initiative always be tracked and roll a new initiative every time combat starts and ends. This can help ensure each player gets a chance to explore and role play equally.*

*When delving, treat the referees turn as the dungeon turn, rolling any dice, updating any parts of the environment, adjusting timers, etc.*
