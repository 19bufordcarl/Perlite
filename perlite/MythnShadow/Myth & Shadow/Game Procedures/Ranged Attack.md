# Ranged Attack

To make a ranged attack, you make a [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] [[Check\|Check]] and compare the result to the target's [[../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Armor Class\|Armor Class]], generally equal to the target's [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Dexterity\|Dexterity]]. On a success, you roll damage die according to whatever [[../Items/Equipment/Weapons|Weapon]] you used to make the attack, and add your [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] to get the final damage.

The range of the weapon you use represents how far you can hit a target. You incur a -2 penalty to attack [[Check\|Check]] per time you would need to add the range to reach the distance to the target. To a maximum of -20. After that attacks are out of range of that weapon.

Improvised ranged attacks like throwing a rock deal damage equal to your [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Strength\|Strength]] and have a range of 5'.

Making a ranged attack [[Check\|Check]] while [[../Conditions/Threatened\|Threatened]] by a melee combatant imposes [[Dice Rolls/Disadvantage|Disadvantage]].

Example table for ranged attack penalties. Functionally, these penalties can be treated instead as bonuses to the defending creatures [[../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Armor Class\|AC]]. Ties use the lesser penalty.

### Line of Sight and Cover Rules
- If a target is behind cover, the attacker receives an additional -2 penalty. 
- If the target is totally obstructed from the attacker, but the attacker knows their precise location (within a 5’ square), they can make an attack with an additional -10 penalty and [[Dice Rolls/Disadvantage|Disadvantage]] provided there exists a reasonable path for the projectile’s arc to the target. 
- If the attacker does not know the precise location or there is no reasonable path for the projectile then no attack can be made.
