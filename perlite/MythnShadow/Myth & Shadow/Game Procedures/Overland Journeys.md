# Overland Journeys (Hex Crawls)

While on a journey (hex crawl), days are divided into six [[Watches\|Watches]]: 
	Three for day
	Three for night 

If the party is traveling along a road or safe area, it is generally better to abstract the journey into the total time / rations it will take and roll for 1 encounter at the halfway point, or none at all. 

If there is very little to no danger, this level of granularity provides no gameplay value. Use watches and hex crawl rules for overland travel only when traversing dangerous areas.

Roll the journey hazard die according to the danger level table below.

## Overland Journey Danger Level

| Danger Level | When to roll hazard die   |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| Safe         | Never                     |
| Normal       | At dawn                   |
| Risky        | At dawn and at dusk       |
| Deadly       | Every [[Watches\|Watch]] |

## Journey Hazard Die

At the start of each day (6 [[Watches\|Watches]]), roll the Journey Hazard Die (d6).

| d6  | Result                                                            |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Encounter: The referee should have something prepared, or a table |
| 2-6 | Free: No effect                                                   |

### Overworld Encounter Tips

The nature of overworld encounters is intended to allow the referee to build out the world. The following is the encounter generation for the default setting. You can use it, or use it as a reference point for building your own.

#### Encounter Time of Day
In normal areas, roll 2d12 for the 24 hour time of the encounter. This makes nighttime ambushes more rare as they are the most punishing.

In risky areas, the dawn encounter happens at noon, the dusk encounter happens at midnight.

In deadly areas, the encounter happens at the end of the specified watch.

#### Encounter Random Table
There are numerous historic random tables for generating encounters based on the environment. Myth & Shadow does not specify any in particular, you are encouraged to use your favorites or build your own. It is assumed that the probability distribution of your encounters tables is roughly:

| 2d6 | Encounter                             |
| --- | ------------------------------------- |
| 2   | Extreme Danger: Far above party level |
| 3   | High Danger: Above party level        |
| 4   | High Danger: Above party level        |
| 5   | Moderate Danger: About party level    |
| 6   | Moderate Danger: About party level    |
| 7   | Moderate Danger: About party level    |
| 8   | Low Danger: Below party level         |
| 9   | Low Danger: Below party level         |
| 10  | Social Encounter: Wary                |
| 11  | Social Encounter: Neutral             |
| 12  | Social Encounter: Friendly            |
Not all encounters are assumed to be monsters. Some could be environmental, perhaps the onset of a blizzard, and some could even be helpful, perhaps a traveling merchant, or a mythical spirit animal. This helps keep the variety of the game high.

#### Creature Distance
If the encounter is a creature / monster, have each PC make a perception ([[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Wisdom\|Wisdom]]) [[Check\|Check]], with a [[DC\|DC]] equal to 10 + (2 x the creature's [[../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Level|Level]]).
- If any player succeeds, they spot the creature at a distance of about 200 feet.
	- (100 + 3d6 x 10 feet away if random is desired).
	- If any player succeeded by 5 or more, the creature is unaware of them.
		- Remaining undetected for an extended time requires stealth ([[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Dexterity\|Dexterity]]) [[Check\|Checks]].
- If all players fail they do not spot the creature until it is 30 feet away.
	- They are not surprised for [[Initiative\|Initiative]] unless they were sleeping or the creature was deliberately being stealthy.
