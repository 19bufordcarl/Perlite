# Critical Hit

When making a [[../Melee Attack|Melee]] or [[../Ranged Attack|Ranged Attack]], if you rolled a [[Critical Success\|Critical Success]], you can do a critical hit.

A critical hit lets you double the damage dealt from each [[../../Damage Types/!Damage Types|Damage Type]] on that attack.

Maths Note
- While each damage type is doubled separately, this is relevant only for the purposes of the [[../../Conditions/Resistant|Resistant]], [[../../Conditions/Vulnerable|Vulnerable]], or [[../../Conditions/Immune|Immune]] conditions.
- If none of those apply, the distributive property means that you can just get the total damage and double that.
