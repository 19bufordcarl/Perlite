# Critical Cast

When making an [[../../Magic/Spellcasting|Spellcasting]] [[../Check|Check]], if you rolled a [[Critical Success\|Critical Success]], you can do a critical cast.

A critical cast allows you to double any numerical effect of that spell for the duration of that spell, or double the duration itself.
