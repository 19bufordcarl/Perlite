# Weapons

A weapon is an item that can be used to make an [[../../Game Procedures/Attack|Attack]]. Doing so allows the user to deal roll the weapon's specified damage die (or dice) and then add any relevant [[../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Ability Scores|Ability Score(s)]] to get the resulting damage applied from the [[../../Game Procedures/Attack|Attack]].

See [[Individual Item Cards/Weapons/Weapon Properties/Large X Property|Weapon Properties]] for details on what each property means.

## Sheathes
Any weapon you get is assumed to come with the appropriate sheathe, which is what takes up the [[../../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Item Slots|Item Slot]] in your adventurer's pack even when your weapon is drawn.

## Quivers
Ranged weapons come with an empty quiver. A quiver itself does not take up a slot, it is just storage space. Only the ammo takes up slots. Each quiver can hold 1 slots worth of ammo.
