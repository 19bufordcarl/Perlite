# Large X
#LargeX means that you attack with [[../../../../../Game Procedures/Dice Rolls/Disadvantage|Disadvantage]] unless you have X [[../../../../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Strength|Strength]].
	When you succeed on an [[../../../../../Game Procedures/Attack|Attack]], roll double the damage dice and use the highest result(s).

The heavy weight of these weapons decreases the variability of their damage.
