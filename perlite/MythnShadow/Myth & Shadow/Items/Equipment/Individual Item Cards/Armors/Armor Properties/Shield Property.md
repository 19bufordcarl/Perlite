# Shield
#Shield is the main property of all shields.
	Shields require a one free hand to wield.
	Shields grant the bearer the Shield Block ability.

#### Shield Block
Shield Block is a [[../../../../../Game Procedures/Reaction|Reaction]]. 

You may use this reaction after an [[../../../../../Game Procedures/Attack|Attack]] against you is made, but before damage is rolled. 

You attempt to block the [[../../../../../Game Procedures/Attack|Attack's]] [[../../../../../Damage Types/Bludgeoning|Bludgeoning]], [[../../../../../Damage Types/Piercing|Piercing]], or [[../../../../../Damage Types/Slashing|Slashing]] damage.
	Make a [[../../../../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Strength|Strength]] [[../../../../../Game Procedures/Check|Check]] with a [[../../../../../Game Procedures/DC|DC]] equal to the target's [[../../../../../Game Procedures/Attack|Attack]] roll.
		On a successful block, the shield bearer reduces one of the stated damage types by an additional 5 to their armor's reduction value.
		On a failure, damage proceeds as normal.
		
(Reminder that [[../../../../../Game Procedures/Reaction|Reactions]] can only be used once per [[../../../../../Game Procedures/Round|Round]]).
