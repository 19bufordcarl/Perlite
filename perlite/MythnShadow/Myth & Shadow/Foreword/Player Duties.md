# Player Duties

See Knave 2e, copied here for convenience.
## Assist the GM
Take as much work off of the GM’s shoulders as you can. Show up on time, bring snacks, learn the rules, keep session notes, draw maps, be ready for your turn, and tell the GM your short and longterm plans so they can have material ready. 

## Play Your Character
###### Fitting In
Talk to the GM and the other players to make sure your PC meshes with the setting and tone of the game. Avoid creating inter-party conflicts unless the other players agree. 
###### Standing Out 
Give your PC some distinctive features that set them apart from the other characters. Note that it’s fine to play very in-character or to treat your character more like a pawn. Doing voices is optional. Find a way to play that you enjoy. 

## Confront the World
###### Take Initiative
Work with the other players to set your own goals and make your own fun rather than waiting for it to come to you. 
###### Ask Questions
Information is the lifeblood of the game. Get as much of it as you can. Search rooms, experiment, consult sages, etc. 
###### Apply Tactical Infinity
Treat the campaign setting as if it was real and turn the world to your advantage. No detail is simply “flavor.” 
###### Scheme
Avoid risky plans that require you to roll dice. Instead, create plans so clever and airtight that success is certain. Use psychology, magic, equipment, NPCs, and the environment to overcome obstacles rather than your ability scores. 
###### Think Ahead
Remember that your actions can have long-term consequences and NPCs will remember what you’ve done. Rash or impulsive actions can come back to haunt you. 
###### Fight Dirty
Avoid getting into fights where you don’t have the upper hand. Combat in Knave is neither balanced nor fair, so if you must fight, fight like your life depends on it. 

## Prepare to Die
Embrace your character’s death when it happens and roll up a new PC to take their place. Losing a PC makes for great stories, lets you try out new characters, and can thrust the party into unexpected situations.
