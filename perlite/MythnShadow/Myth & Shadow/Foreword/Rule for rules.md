# The Rule for Rules

The more specific ruling should overrule a more general rule, unless it causes a paradox or especially problematic interaction. The referees rulings are the most specific, as they are tailored to the situation and thus are final.

Unless otherwise specified, decimal numbers should always be rounded down (truncated).

- 4.5 = 4
- 4.1 = 4
- 4.9 = 4
