## Prepare for Sessions
###### Places
Create environments for the PCs to explore. Seed these environments with treasures to collect, enemies to fight, devices to tinker with, people to talk to, wonders to gawk at, terrors to flee, problems to solve, and powder-keg situations to explode. 
###### People 
Give NPCs and monsters personalities, loyalties, and motivations, and entangle their lives together. 
###### Things 
Create tools, spells, weapons, and magical artifacts that evoke wonder and promote creative problem solving. 

## Host the Game 
###### Facilitate
Host the game like you’d host a party. Present opportunities, but let the players guide the action. 
###### Check In 
Check in with the players to make sure everyone (including you) is having a good time. If not, adjust the game or have a conversation about the campaign’s expectations. 

## Play the World
###### Arbitrate 
Be impartial and consistent when you make rulings. The players should be playing against the world, not against you. Roll dice in the open, unless the PCs would not know the results.
###### Verisimilitude
Strive to pull the players into the world by making it a living, internally consistent place. Use random tables and generators to keep things fresh and surprising. 
###### When to Roll 
Never roll dice when common sense tells you the logical outcome. 
###### Reward Player Creativity 
Allow the players’ actions to have a major impact on the campaign, especially when they come up with ingenious solutions that bypass or eliminate obstacles. 
###### Reveal the World 
Give the players plenty of information about what is happening in the game world. When in doubt, give them more. Without information, players cannot make smart choices. 
###### Signpost Danger
The more dangerous a thing is, the more obvious it should be. Don’t penalize players with consequences they could not have avoided. 

## Keep Time Records
###### Maintain Urgency 
Time is a resource for players, so it should be tracked carefully. Wasting it should have consequences. 
###### Calendar
Make a calendar and track the days. What are other NPCs and factions up to while the players are adventuring? What holidays are NPCs celebrating? What threats are growing closer? 

## Hack the Rules
The rules are your servant, not your master. If a rule isn’t working the way your group likes, talk to them about it and then tailor things to fit.
