*Optional Rule:*
*For a more deadly feel to the environment even as PCs level up, environmental damage can bypass [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) and damage a PCs [Health Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) directly*
