# Biological Hazards

## Hunger
- Not eating for a day prevents PCs from regaining [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) or [Health Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md). 
- When PCs are in civilization, they can simply deduct 1 coin at the end of the day to buy meals.
- When PCs are in the wilderness, they can spend a [Watch](../Game%20Procedures/Watches.md) to hunt or forage with a successful survival [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) ([Wisdom](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md)) with a DC corresponding to the terrain.

## Thirst
- After one day of not drinking, a PCs [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) are drained to 0. The PC is [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md).
- After three days, they must make a [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) save or die every hour. 
- If PCs are near fresh water, they are assumed to be Only relevant if they stray from a water source. Staying in a wetland or near a river or body of water is important.

## Sleep Derivation
- After one night without sleep, a PCs [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) are drained to 0. 
	- If they go another day without sleep, they gain the [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition. 
		- Each subsequent watch the PC must succeed a DC 15 + days awake [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) to remain awake, or they collapse [Unconscious](../Conditions/Unconscious.md). 

## Drunkenness
- For each hour a PC spends drinking, they make a [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) check. On a failure, they are drunk and take 1d6 [Necrotic](../Damage%20Types/Necrotic.md) damage.
	- If this damage causes a loss of [Health Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md), they fall [Unconscious](../Conditions/Unconscious.md) too.
	- A drunk character gains the [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.
