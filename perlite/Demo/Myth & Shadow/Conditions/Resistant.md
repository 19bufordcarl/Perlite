# Resistant

If you are resistant to a [Damage Type](../Damage%20Types/!Damage%20Types.md), you take half damage from that damage type.

If that damage requires you to make a [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md), (to save against poison or disease for example) you have [Advantage](../Dice%20Rolls/Advantage.md) on that check.
