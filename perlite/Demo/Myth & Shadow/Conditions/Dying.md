# Dying

When you start dying, you roll a d4 and add your [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Constitution\|Constitution]]. You will die after that many [[../Game Procedures/Turn\|Turns]]. 
	There is a minimum of 1 turn for your dying roll.

At the start of each of your subsequent turns, roll a d20. On a natural 20 you regain consciousness with 1 [[../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Health Points\|Health Points]] and gain the [[Exhausted\|Exhausted]] condition. Otherwise, you decrease your 'turns until death' counter by 1. When this counter reaches 0 you die. 
	Ex. I start dying and I roll a 1 on my d4 and have 0 CON. On my turn I roll a 14. My 'turns until death counter' becomes 0. I die right there. I do not pass go. I do not collect $200. 

While you are dying you are [[Unconscious\|Unconscious]].

While you are dying an ally can spend an action to [[Stabilized\|Stabilize]] you with a DC 15 [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] [[../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]].

When you are brought back to consciousness from dying, you gain the [[Exhausted\|Exhausted]] condition.
