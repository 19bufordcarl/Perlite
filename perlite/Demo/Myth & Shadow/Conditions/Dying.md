# Dying

When you start dying, you roll a d4 and add your [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md). You will die after that many [Turns](../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md). 
	There is a minimum of 1 turn for your dying roll.

At the start of each of your subsequent turns, roll a d20. On a natural 20 you regain consciousness with 1 [Health Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) and gain the [Exhausted](Exhausted.md) condition. Otherwise, you decrease your 'turns until death' counter by 1. When this counter reaches 0 you die. 
	Ex. I start dying and I roll a 1 on my d4 and have 0 CON. On my turn I roll a 14. My 'turns until death counter' becomes 0. I die right there. I do not pass go. I do not collect $200. 

While you are dying you are [Unconscious](Unconscious.md).

While you are dying an ally can spend an action to [Stabilize](Stabilized.md) you with a DC 15 [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md).

When you are brought back to consciousness from dying, you gain the [Exhausted](Exhausted.md) condition.
