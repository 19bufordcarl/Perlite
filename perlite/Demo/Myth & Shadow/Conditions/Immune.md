# Immune

If you are immune to a [[../Damage Types/!Damage Types\|Damage Type]] you take no damage from that type.

If that damage would cause you to make a [[../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]], you automatically succeed and are immune to the results of that check as well.
	- Ex. immunity to poison damage also makes you immune to the effect of that poison causing you to fall [[Unconscious\|Unconscious]].
