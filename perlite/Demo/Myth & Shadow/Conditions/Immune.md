# Immune

If you are immune to a [Damage Type](../Damage%20Types/!Damage%20Types.md) you take no damage from that type.

If that damage would cause you to make a [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md), you automatically succeed and are immune to the results of that check as well.
	- Ex. immunity to poison damage also makes you immune to the effect of that poison causing you to fall [Unconscious](Unconscious.md).
