Infernal [Ancestry](Ancestry.md)
##### Setting Lore
*Known by most of the other cultures as Infernals, it is a translation into common from their tongue, where they call themselves "Cendraeri" literally "Ones Reborn from Ash". The volcanic Raven Ridge mountains have crafted mighty warriors through fire. Their legends say that they were once a tribe of humans, whose religious leaders learned from the great [Erevanthe](../../Magic/Spells/Patrons/Patron%20Index/Erevanthe.md), a mysterious deity. From their knowledge, they were blessed with glorious horns, as well as superior strength and intellect.* 

*Other ancestries are unlikely to have ever seen an Infernal and might treat one they encounter with superstition, possible having heard legends about their heathen deities and religious practices. Most [Lizardfolk](Lizardfolk.md) hate the Infernals because of their enslavement after the Infernals conquered the northern parts of the Xar'lith jungle.* 

*Infernal culture tends to value family, honor, and power. They dislike the Empire because it threatens their independence.*
