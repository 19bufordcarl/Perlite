# Item Slot

An item slot is used as the unit of abstraction of [[Carry Capacity\|Carry Weight]] for the purpose of making managing inventory streamlined and enjoyable for gameplay. 

An item slot is something that either 
	1. Weighs around 5 pounds **OR** 
	2. Is about as big as a bicycle helmet 

The goal of the system is to preserve verisimilitude of how much stuff PCs can reasonably have on them, as well as provide opportunities for decisions with clear costs. Example: Do I carry an additional torch into the dungeon or a shield?
