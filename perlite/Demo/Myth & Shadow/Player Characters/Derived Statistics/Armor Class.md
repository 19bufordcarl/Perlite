# Armor Class (aka Attack Class)

A creatures Armor Class or Attack Class (AC) represents how hard it is to hit that creature. AC is a particular type of [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) used for attack checks. An attack [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) must meet or beat a targets AC to deal damage. A failure is considered a miss, and deals no damage.

A creature's AC is equal to their [Dexterity](../Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md).

While a creatures AC could in theory be negative, the fact that a natural 1 is a [Critical Miss](../../Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miss.md) means that it is always possible for an attack to miss.

*Authorâ€™s Note:*
*AC is unrelated to [Armor](../../Items/Basic%20Equipment/Armor.md) the item, [Armor](../../Items/Basic%20Equipment/Armor.md) reduces physical damage.*

*A player's armor class is kept as this name for the historical purpose of AC being recognizable as the number you roll on the d20 to "hit".*

*The name attack class can be used as it is more accurate, either way it abbreviates to AC.*
