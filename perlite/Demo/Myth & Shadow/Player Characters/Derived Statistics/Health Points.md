# Health Points

##### Your max HP is equal to 10 + your [Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md)

Health Points (HP) represent your physical health. When your HP is reduced to 0, you fall unconscious and die in d4 + 1 [Rounds](../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md) at the start of your [Turn](../../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md) that round.

When you take damage, you reduce your [Fatigue Points](Fatigue%20Points.md) before you reduce your HP. When you are out of FP you start talking HP damage, and that is bad news.

HP regenerates slowly, after Full [Resting](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md) you can restore 1 HP. 
## Scars
If you ever take 5 or more damage to your HP from a single hit, you incur a [Scar](Scars.md).
	Each scar you have reduces your [Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) by 1.
