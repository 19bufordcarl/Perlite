# Health Points

##### Your max HP is equal to 10 + your [[../Chosen Statistics/Constitution\|Constitution]]

Health Points (HP) represent your physical health. When your HP is reduced to 0, you fall unconscious and die in d4 + 1 [[../../Game Procedures/Round\|Rounds]] at the start of your [[../../Game Procedures/Turn\|Turn]] that round.

When you take damage, you reduce your [[Fatigue Points\|Fatigue Points]] before you reduce your HP. When you are out of FP you start talking HP damage, and that is bad news.

HP regenerates slowly, after Full [[../../Game Procedures/Resting\|Resting]] you can restore 1 HP. 
## Scars
If you ever take 5 or more damage to your HP from a single hit, you incur a [[Scars\|Scar]].
	Each scar you have reduces your [[../Chosen Statistics/Constitution\|Constitution]] by 1.
