# Scars

Scars are gained whenever a PC loses 5 or more [[Health Points\|Health Points]] from a single hit. Each scar a PC has reduces that PCs [[../Chosen Statistics/Constitution\|Constitution]] by 1, and that player should change the description of the PC slightly to reflect this scar.

If incurring a scar would cause you exceed your [[Carry Capacity\|Carry Capacity]], you drop whatever you are holding in your hands in pain. If you are holding nothing you fall to the ground [[../../Conditions/Prone\|Prone]]. 

Scars do not heal naturally, and even minor magic cannot heal a scar. Healing scars usually comes from powerful magic and remedies, usually accessible for PCs at around level 5.
