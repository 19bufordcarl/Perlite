# Experience Points

Experience Points (XP) represents the PCs progression throughout the game. 

The referee announces when a PC gets XP. It is recommended each PC in the group gets the same number of XP in a session.

How the referee awards XP is up to them (objectives achieved, coins retrieved, monsters killed) all can work well.

## Session Method (Character Games)
The default XP rule is as follows. 
- The referee awards 1-5 XP at the end of the session based on how successful the party was that session, however this campaign defines success. 
	- XP rewards of 3 or 4 should be how much a competent group usually gets. 
	- 5 XP is reserved for especially impactful sessions 
	- 1 XP is reserved for the party's worst defeats. 
	- This allows flexibility of what success for a given party looks like and puts the referee and players on the same page for how close they are to leveling up. 
	- This also removes any fuss over minor XP squabbles since it happens at the end of the session and is easily calculated.
- PCs level up at 10 XP and resets to 0.
- XP should get harder to acquire as PCs get to higher levels.
- Levels 5 and up may require PCs to complete a 'quest' to level up.

Generally it is required that PCs full [[../../Game Procedures/Resting\|Rest]] in order to level up. For a more realistic campaign, the referee may require the PCs spend an extended period of downtime to level up, potentially in a city or equivalent location. This is ultimately up to the referee and the specific campaign style.

There is an argument to be made that we learn more from our failures than our successes. While this is true, the behavior a game rewards is the behavior a game encourages, and we don't want the PCs to be trying to fail, it makes for a bad story and a bad game.

## Treasure Method (Campaign Games)
The treasure method from Shadowdark works well for games that know they want to focus on treasure hunting. The rules from Shadowdark are as follows:
- PCs get XP when they find treasure
- A normal treasure is 1 XP, a rare treasure is 3 XP, a mythic treasure is 10 XP
- All PCs in the party get the XP, not just the PC who finds the treasure
- You level up when you have XP = 10 x [[Level\|Level]] and then XP resets to 0
- *Recommended Rule: Combat XP*
	- *Defeated monsters grant XP equal to half their level, rounded down.*
#### Treasure XP Table

| Tier   | XP  | Approximate worth in coins |
| ------ | --- | -------------------------- |
| Poor   | 0   | <100                       |
| Normal | 1   | 100-1000                   |
| Rare   | 3   | 1000-50000                 |
| Mythic | 10  | 50000+                     |
If a treasure is on the borderline of normal and rare:
	Roll 1d4 to determine the XP value.

*Authors Note:*
*Carousing / training rules are not included for the following reasons. If players can spend money to get XP, they will always do so, unless there is a powerful item they can buy that is as good a rate as leveling up is. If you don’t want to stock magic item shops and prepare to do shopping every level up, then this will likely never be the case with mundane items. Gating XP behind spending money makes the players desperate to spend their money, and they will not want to save up for things.*

*I prefer to run carousing more free flow and unpredictably rather than a defined system to keep the feel of it being wild, rather than spend money for XP. Random tables that result in gaining / losing resources with a negative EV are my recommendation. There is a potential benefit but it’s not a free money / xp generator.*
