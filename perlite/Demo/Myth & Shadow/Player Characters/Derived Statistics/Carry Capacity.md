# Carry Capacity

This game uses an Item Slot system (think Minecraft). An item slot is an abstracted unit of weight / space combined for ease of inventory management. 

A PC with an adventurer's pack (see [Delver's Kit](../../Items/Basic%20Equipment/Delver's%20Kit.md)) has 10 [Item Slots](Item%20Slots.md). 

An item slot is something that 
	1. Weighs about 5 pounds **OR** 
	2. Is about as big as a bicycle helmet 

Smaller items of the same thing can be bundled together into 1 slot. The common examples are
	1. 2 days of rations
	2. 10 of certain [Gear](../../Items/Basic%20Equipment/Standard%20Gear.md) (iron spikes, candles, etc.)
	3. 20 pieces of most ammunition (arrows, bolts, sling stones, etc.)
	4. 500 [Coins](../../Referee%20Specific/Economy/Coins.md) 
		1. (Number of slots rounds down, so 0-500 takes up 0 slots)
	5. 500 coins worth of [Mythril](../../Magic/Mythril.md) powder 
		1. (Number of slots rounds down, so 0-500 takes up 0 slots)

If a PC wishes to carry more than can fit in their pack, then they can get a cart, wagon, horse, or similar item. See [Standard Gear](../../Items/Basic%20Equipment/Standard%20Gear.md). 

While a PC is [Delving](../../Game%20Procedures/Delving.md), they can choose to put their weapons and shield away to carry a single box-like item of weight less than 50 + (25 * [Strength](../Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md)). While carrying this box, you considered surprised for all [Initiative](../../Game%20Procedures/Initiative.md) rolls.
- If this box is less than half your carry weight, 
	- then you can carry the box indefinitely. (So you could [Overland Journey](../../Game%20Procedures/Overland%20Journeys.md) with it).
- If the box if greater than half your carry weight, 
	- then you can carry this box for a number of delve [Rounds](../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md) equal to twice your [Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md).

Worn items such as clothing and [Armor](../../Items/Basic%20Equipment/Armor.md) do not take up any slots. [Weapons](../../Items/Basic%20Equipment/Weapons.md) and ammo do.
	The sheathes for your weapons and quivers for your ammo become part of your pack.
