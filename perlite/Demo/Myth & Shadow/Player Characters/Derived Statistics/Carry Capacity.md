# Carry Capacity

This game uses an Item Slot system (think Minecraft). An item slot is an abstracted unit of weight / space combined for ease of inventory management. 

A PC with an adventurer's pack (see [[../../Items/Basic Equipment/Delver's Kit\|Delver's Kit]]) has 10 [[Item Slots\|Item Slots]]. 

An item slot is something that 
	1. Weighs about 5 pounds **OR** 
	2. Is about as big as a bicycle helmet 

Smaller items of the same thing can be bundled together into 1 slot. The common examples are
	1. 2 days of rations
	2. 10 of certain [[../../Items/Basic Equipment/Standard Gear\|Gear]] (iron spikes, candles, etc.)
	3. 20 pieces of most ammunition (arrows, bolts, sling stones, etc.)
	4. 500 [[../../Referee Specific/Economy/Coins\|Coins]] 
		1. (Number of slots rounds down, so 0-500 takes up 0 slots)
	5. 500 coins worth of [[../../Magic/Mythril\|Mythril]] powder 
		1. (Number of slots rounds down, so 0-500 takes up 0 slots)

If a PC wishes to carry more than can fit in their pack, then they can get a cart, wagon, horse, or similar item. See [[../../Items/Basic Equipment/Standard Gear\|Standard Gear]]. 

While a PC is [[../../Game Procedures/Delving\|Delving]], they can choose to put their weapons and shield away to carry a single box-like item of weight less than 50 + (25 * [[../Chosen Statistics/Strength\|Strength]]). While carrying this box, you considered surprised for all [[../../Game Procedures/Initiative\|Initiative]] rolls.
- If this box is less than half your carry weight, 
	- then you can carry the box indefinitely. (So you could [[../../Game Procedures/Overland Journeys\|Overland Journey]] with it).
- If the box if greater than half your carry weight, 
	- then you can carry this box for a number of delve [[../../Game Procedures/Round\|Rounds]] equal to twice your [[../Chosen Statistics/Constitution\|Constitution]].

Worn items such as clothing and [[../../Items/Basic Equipment/Armor\|Armor]] do not take up any slots. [[../../Items/Basic Equipment/Weapons\|Weapons]] and ammo do.
	The sheathes for your weapons and quivers for your ammo become part of your pack.
