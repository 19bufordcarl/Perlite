# Fatigue Points

##### Your max FP is equal to [Level](Level.md) + ([Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) x 2)

Fatigue Points (FP) represent your pool of combat experience, endurance, and skill. When you take damage, you reduce your FP before you reduce your [Health Points](Health%20Points.md) (HP). When you are out of FP you start talking HP damage, and that is bad news. 

FP regenerates quickly, after [Resting](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md) for at least 1 hour you can restore all your FP.

*Fatigue points cannot be negative. If your FP would be negative, your FP is simply 0.*
