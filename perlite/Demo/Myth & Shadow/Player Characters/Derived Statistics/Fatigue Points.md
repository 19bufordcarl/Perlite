# Fatigue Points

##### Your max FP is equal to [[Level\|Level]] + ([[../Chosen Statistics/Constitution\|Constitution]] x 2)

Fatigue Points (FP) represent your pool of combat experience, endurance, and skill. When you take damage, you reduce your FP before you reduce your [[Health Points\|Health Points]] (HP). When you are out of FP you start talking HP damage, and that is bad news. 

FP regenerates quickly, after [[../../Game Procedures/Resting\|Resting]] for at least 1 hour you can restore all your FP.

*Fatigue points cannot be negative. If your FP would be negative, your FP is simply 0.*
