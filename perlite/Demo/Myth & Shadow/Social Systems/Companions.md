# Companions

Allowing PCs to amass [[.md\|Companions]] is an optional rule. The default assumption is that the PCs cannot have companions, only [[NPC Hirelings\|NPC Hirelings]]. The narrative of the campaign might have it make sense for an NPC to accompany the party for a time, but that need not ever happen.

Lots of companions alter the feel and style of game greatly, and the rest of the system functions fine without them.

Companions follow the party into great danger, even the [[../Hazards/Shadowcurse\|Shadowcurse]], for promise of lavish loot.
## Max Level
A PC cannot have a companion of a level greater than the PCs [[../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Level\|Level]].
## Max Number
A PC can have a number of companions equal to their [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Charisma\|Charisma]].

## Finding Companions
Generally, you can only find companions who start out as level 0 mercenaries (see [[NPC Hirelings\|NPC Hirelings]]). Upon hiring them, they become level 1 companions, and operate effectively as another PC.
### Cost
Companions need a certain amount of money (or loot equivalent) per week to justify their risk and not look for another adventuring party. You can instead give a companion a share of all the loot. If the loot at the end of a month is less than the four times the rate in the table below, the companion makes a loyalty [[../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]] or leaves for better opportunities.

| Companion Level | Cost per Week (coins, 7 days) |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1               | 100                           |
| 2               | 250                           |
| 3               | 500                           |
| 4               | 1,000                         |
| 5               | 2,500                         |
| 6               | 5,000                         |
| 7               | 10,000                        |
| 8               | 25,000                        |
| 9               | 50,000                        |
| 10              | 100,000                       |
Companions are along primarily for the loot. Narrative 'companions' should simply be referee controlled NPCs that accompany the party, and have stats tracked by the referee rather than a true companion.
### Availability
For every 10 available [[NPC Hirelings\|NPC Hireling]] Merchants, there should be roughly 1 who is willing to be a companion. The referee can also design specific companions if they so desire.

## Leveling Up

### Session Method XP
If the PC is two levels higher than a companion at the end of a month, the next time you complete a full [[../Game Procedures/Resting\|Rest]] the companion levels up. In addition to the normal [[../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Level\|Level]] up procedure, increase their loyalty score by 1. (This means that companions will typically be 1 level lower than the party).
### Treasure Method XP
- **Hardcore:** The companions only gain XP for the treasure that is part of their share.
- **Easy:** The companions gain XP with the party.

## Loyalty Checks

Loyalty is the system to handle when companions will abandon the party. To make a loyalty check, the PC who is responsible for the companion makes a [[../Game Procedures/DC\|DC]] 15 [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Charisma\|Charisma]] [[../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]]. The PC may add the Companion's Loyalty Score as an additional bonus to this [[../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]].

The referee should request a loyalty check whenever the following occurs.
- Hardship
	- Offensive actions to the companion.
		- The referee may grant [[../Dice Rolls/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] if it is especially against their nature.
			- Such as not paying them on time or lying about their pay.
		- This should also decrease their loyalty score by 1.
	- In sudden unexpected danger. 
		- Such as a lich awakening from his tomb to a level 2 companion. 
- Opportunity
	- When the party ends a session in a civilized area having not met the companion's rate.
		- This should also decrease their loyalty score by 1.
	- If the follower comes across a particularly powerful artifact / offer.

If a companion fails a loyalty check they leave the party and will not work for that PC again. (Or the party as long as that PC is in the party). They take any items they have on them with them.
### Loyalty Score
A companion's loyalty score represents how likely they are to stick with the party. A new companion has a loyalty score of 0. Loyalty scores change on the following events.

- Increase loyalty by 1
	- Whenever the companion gains a level.
	- Whenever a PC saves the companion from near certain death.
	- Whenever the payment for a month comes out to more than twice the expected rate.
- Decrease loyalty by 1
	- Whenever a PC does an offensive action to the companion that prompts a check.
	- Whenever their monthly rate fails to be met.
