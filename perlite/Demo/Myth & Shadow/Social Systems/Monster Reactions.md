# Monster Reactions

When encountering a monster from a random table, usually when [Delving](../Game%20Procedures/Delving.md) or during an [Overland Journey](../Game%20Procedures/Overland%20Journeys.md), if the monster would not clearly be hostile, then you can roll for its reaction.
- Undead would clearly be hostile for example.

The encountering PC may add their [Charisma](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) to the 2d6 roll.
