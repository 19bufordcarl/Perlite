# NPC Labor Cost and Availability
If the players wish to hire NPCs, the following information applies. Hirable NPCs are still quite risk averse. They will not venture into areas affected by the [[../Hazards/Shadowcurse\|Shadowcurse]] or similar danger.

When in danger, hirelings must make [[Morale System\|Morale]] [[../Game Procedures/Check\|Checks]].
## Commoners
1 days worth of labor is 1 coin. The additional risk increases their cost to 2 coins. Commoners will not enter any area affected by the [[../Hazards/Shadowcurse\|Shadowcurse]], or similar danger level. Posting notices to canvas a location takes a full day of effort, and only yields new NPCs once per month. You find a number of willing commoners according to the table. Commoners have 1d8 [[../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Health Points\|HP]], [[../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Level\|Level]] 0 and 0 for all [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Ability Scores\|Ability Scores]]. You must supply them with any and all equipment aside from clothing, pack, and bedroll. They do not gain XP or levels.

| Number of Willing Commoners                                                      | Location           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 1d6 + [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Charisma\|Charisma]]      | Village (100s)     |
| 3d6 + [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Charisma\|Charisma]]      | Town (1,000s)      |
| 3d6 x [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Charisma\|Charisma]]      | City (10,000s)     |
| 3d6 x [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Charisma\|Charisma]] x 10 | Capitol (100,000+) |
## Mercenaries
Mercenaries know more of the dangers of the world and come equipped with their own gear. ([[../Items/Basic Equipment/Delver's Kit\|Delver's Kit]], Quilt [[../Items/Basic Equipment/Armor\|Armor]], shield, and a random weapon). They understand danger and fighting more. They have 3 points amongst [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Strength\|Strength]], [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Dexterity\|Dexterity]], and [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Constitution\|Constitution]], and a base of 10 HP. They are still level 0 and do not gain XP or levels. To venture with you, they want 5 coins per day. They will not venture into areas affected by the [[../Hazards/Shadowcurse\|Shadowcurse]], or similar danger. Searching a location for mercenaries takes a full day, and new mercenaries become available.

| Number of Available Mercenaries | Location           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 1d4                             | Village (100s)     |
| 2d4                             | Town (1,000s)      |
| 2d12                            | City (10,000s)     |
| 2d12x10                         | Capitol (100,000+) |

And may not be desirable for all campaigns. In order to attract hiring a specialists, the PCs will need to have their own at least small keep.
