# Piercing

The damage done by piercing the target. Projectile [Weapons](../Items/Basic%20Equipment/Weapons.md) are known for doing this type of damage, bow arrows, crossbow bolts, throwing knives are the most common sources of this damage.

If an melee weapon has a edge, it can also usually be used to pierce. Typically even battle axes would have some spear like appendage in between the axe heads. Player / DM discretion in these case is advised.
