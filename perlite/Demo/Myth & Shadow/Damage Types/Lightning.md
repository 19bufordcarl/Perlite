# Lightning

Lightning damage, sometimes also referred to as shock damage involves channeling the energy of natures worst storms. This damage type is usually associated with the [Aer](../Magic/Spell%20Domains/Air.md) domain, but it also can draw on [Pyros](../Magic/Spell%20Domains/Fire.md) and [Aqua](../Magic/Spell%20Domains/Water.md).
