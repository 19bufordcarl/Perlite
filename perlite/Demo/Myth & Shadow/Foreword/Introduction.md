# Introduction

I want to create a TTRPG that emphasizes (in order)

1. Verisimilitude
2. Player choice
3. Progression
4. Tactics 

I believe that with these ingredients you get the most ability for engaging stories at the table beyond whatever the referee has planned. Verisimilitude is paramount because if I as player don't believe in the consistency of the world than I cannot make plans to act in it, my choices feel arbitrary. As a result, the progression won't make sense or won't feel earned, I won't really care about the tactics, and the story will fall apart.

Everything stems from the players buying in, and so getting the players to buy in is my paramount task. I endeavor to run games that I want to play in, so the verisimilitude I opt for is one that makes me feel good about it when I run the game, with the belief that this attitude will rub off on my players. Belief is contagious.
