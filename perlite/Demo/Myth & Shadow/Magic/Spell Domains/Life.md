# Life

Arcane: Vitalis

Spells from the life [[!Domain Index\|domain]] draw their energy from the spirit realm, where all mortal souls come from. Most malevolent deities reside in the void, and draw energy from mortal spirits, into the realm of death. Some scholars would say they are misunderstood and there is more to the story. Pure heresy.
