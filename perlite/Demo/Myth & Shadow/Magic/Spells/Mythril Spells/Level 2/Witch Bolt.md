Shocking blue lightning energy shoots out from your fingertips. The bolt connects to one target of your choice in range and an arc of lightning connects you to them. The target takes 1d6 [[../../../../Damage Types/Lightning\|Lightning]] damage now and at the start of each of your [[../../../../Game Procedures/Turn\|Turns]]. 

If you lose concentration or the lightning arc is blocked or exceeds its range the spell ends.

*Upcast: Deal an additional 1d6 damage per spell level.*
