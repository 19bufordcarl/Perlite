If you would take damage whose source is the one of the elemental magical [[../../../Spell Domains/!Domain Index\|Domains]] [[../../../Spell Domains/Air\|Air]], [[../../../Spell Domains/Earth\|Earth]], [[../../../../Damage Types/Fire\|Fire]], or [[../../../Spell Domains/Water\|Water]], you can cast this spell to become [[../../../../Conditions/Resistant\|Resistant]] to a [[../../../../Damage Types/!Damage Types\|Damage Type]] of that magic. 

Your next melee attack does an additional 1d6 damage of the damage type absorbed.

*Upcast: Deal an additional 1d6 damage per spell level.*
