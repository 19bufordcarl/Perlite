You magically prevent a portal (door, gate, etc.) from opening.  

- The [[../Level 2/Knock\|Knock]] spell opens the portal immediately, ending this spell. 
- Creatures that are 3 or more [[../../../../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Level\|Levels]] higher than you can open the held portal with an [[../../../../Game Procedures/Action\|Action]].

The portal continues to be held closed even once you are out of range.

*Upcast: No effect.*
