You conjure a circular disk of force with a concave center, capable of carrying up to 20 [[../../../../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Item Slots\|Item Slots]]. The disk hovers at waist height and automatically remains within 30 feet. 

It cannot traverse sudden elevation changes larger than 10 feet a more, as it always floats around 3 feet above the ground.

*Upcast: No effect.*
