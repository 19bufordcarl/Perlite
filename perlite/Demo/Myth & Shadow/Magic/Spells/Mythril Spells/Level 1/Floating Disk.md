You conjure a circular disk of force with a concave center, capable of carrying up to 20 [Item Slots](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slots.md). The disk hovers at waist height and automatically remains within 30 feet. 

It cannot traverse sudden elevation changes larger than 10 feet a more, as it always floats around 3 feet above the ground.

*Upcast: No effect.*
