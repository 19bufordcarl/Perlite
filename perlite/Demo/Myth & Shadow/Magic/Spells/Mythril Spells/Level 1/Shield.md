After the referee declares the result of the attack [[../../../../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]] against you, you can cast this spell. Your [[../../../../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Armor Class\|Armor Class]] becomes equal to the result of your [[../../../Spellcasting\|Spellcasting]] [[../../../../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]], potentially causing the attack to miss.

This shield absorbs [[Magic Missile\|Magic Missiles]].
