While this spell is active, creatures from the [Death](../../../Spell%20Domains/Death.md) domain have [Disadvantage](../../../../Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) on all [Checks](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) against the target. Such creatures are unable to inflict mental conditions on the target such as possession.

If the target is already under the influence of possession or a similar condition, the afflicting creature must make a [Charisma](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) against the caster's last [Spellcasting](../../../Spellcasting.md) check. Should the creature fail this check, the ongoing instance of the effect is immediately dispelled.

*Upcast: You can target one additional creature per spell level.*
