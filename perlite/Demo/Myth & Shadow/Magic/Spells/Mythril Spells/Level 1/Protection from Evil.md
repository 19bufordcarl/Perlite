While this spell is active, creatures from the [[../../../Spell Domains/Death\|Death]] domain have [[../../../../Dice Rolls/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] on all [[../../../../Game Procedures/Check\|Checks]] against the target. Such creatures are unable to inflict mental conditions on the target such as possession.

If the target is already under the influence of possession or a similar condition, the afflicting creature must make a [[../../../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Charisma\|Charisma]] [[../../../../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]] against the caster's last [[../../../Spellcasting\|Spellcasting]] check. Should the creature fail this check, the ongoing instance of the effect is immediately dispelled.

*Upcast: You can target one additional creature per spell level.*
