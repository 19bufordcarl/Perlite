You make this [[../../../Spellcasting\|Spellcasting]] [[../../../../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]] with [[../../../../Dice Rolls/Advantage\|Advantage]].

You shoot a magical bolt of energy at a target that deals 1d4 + 1 [[../../../../Damage Types/Bludgeoning\|Bludgeoning]] or [[../../../../Damage Types/Piercing\|Piercing]] damage. The missiles bend around corners if necessary, they always hit. You need to know the precise location of the target rather than the normal line of sight rules for spellcasting.

*Upcast: You can shoot one additional missile per spell level.*
