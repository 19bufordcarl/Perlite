You can select a number of creatures within range equal to your [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md). Those creatures fall asleep and are [Unconscious](../../../../Conditions/Unconscious.md) if they are level 2 or lower. Any significant physical disturbance wakes them up.

*Upcast: You can put creatures to sleep of one level higher per spell level.*
