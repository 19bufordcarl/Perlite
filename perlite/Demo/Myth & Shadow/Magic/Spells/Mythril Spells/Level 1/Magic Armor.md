For the duration, you are protected by a magical forcefield. Your [[../../../../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Armor Class\|Armor Class]] becomes 13 + your [[../../../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] for all attacks, melee or ranged. Notably you can still wear [[../../../../Items/Basic Equipment/Armor\|Armor]]. On a [[../../../../Dice Rolls/Critical Cast\|Critical Cast]] you can double the dexterity modifier, but not the 13.

*Upcast: No effect.*
