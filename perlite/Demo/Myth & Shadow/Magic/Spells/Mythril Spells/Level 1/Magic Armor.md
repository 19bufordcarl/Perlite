For the duration, you are protected by a magical forcefield. Your [Armor Class](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) becomes 13 + your [Dexterity](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) for all attacks, melee or ranged. Notably you can still wear [Armor](../../../../Items/Basic%20Equipment/Armor.md). On a [Critical Cast](../../../../Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Cast.md) you can double the dexterity modifier, but not the 13.

*Upcast: No effect.*
