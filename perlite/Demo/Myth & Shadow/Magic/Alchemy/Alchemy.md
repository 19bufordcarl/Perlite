# Alchemy

Alchemy was the foundation of magical understanding. All alchemical understanding points towards the following general recipe for successful potion brewing.
## Procedure
Potion brewing requires 
1. A sterile container, usually a glass bottle
2. Twice the [[../Mythril\|Mythril]] required to cast that spell
3. Purified water (usually through an alchemical apparatus to achieve purification) 
4. A [[../Spellcasting\|Spellcasting]] check for that spell, aided by the additional materials you used. 
	1. Generally, spells have 3 materials. Each material used reduces the casting [[../../Game Procedures/DC\|DC]] by 5. 
5. On a success, you have successfully brewed a potion of that spell! 
	1. The brewing process generally takes 1 hour succeed or fail. 
		1. A failure consumes all materials still and yields bad water.
	2. Brewing can be done while [[../../Game Procedures/Resting\|Resting]].
6. Potions retain the ranges of their spells as follows (unless otherwise augmented). 
	1. Self: Liquid must be drunk
	2. Touch/Target: The liquid must touch the target or be drunk
	3. AOE: Explodes in the radius when the bottle is uncorked / broken


As a general rule of thumb effectively all (>99%) of the liquid in a potion must be consumed / coat the target in order for a 'critical mass' of liquid to bind the magical effect. Small tastes can give clues to the effect of a potion, without imbibing the full affect. Potions cannot be split / shared, unless of course they are AOE in which case everyone in the radius incurs the full effect.
