# Spell Levels

Different spells have different power levels, known as spell levels. Typically, a [Spell](Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Spell%20Index.md) of certain level is accessible according to the rule.

Max Spell Level $= \lceil($Caster [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) + Caster [Wisdom](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md)$)/4\rceil$

Said in English, the maximum spell level spell level is equal to one quarter of the sum of caster's [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) and [Wisdom](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) rounded up.

You can only upcast spells to a level less than or equal to your max level.

| Sum   | Max Spell Level |
| ----- | --------------- |
| 1-4   | 1               |
| 5-8   | 2               |
| 9-12  | 3               |
| 13-16 | 4               |
| 17-20 | 5               |
| 21+   | Mythic          |

*Author's Note:*
*These two types of 'level' is a somewhat unfortunate naming scheme inherited from historical RPGs. It is more mental effort to change this language than deal with it in my opinion.*
