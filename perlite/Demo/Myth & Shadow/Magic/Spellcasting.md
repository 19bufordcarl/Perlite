# Spellcasting

Mortals cannot use magic on their own. Magic is fickle, ancient, and poorly understood. Hence why it is called magic. Magic is channeled though [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder, [Patrons](Spells/Patrons/Patron.md), or magic items.

In order to cast a [Spell](Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Spell%20Index.md), you must make the appropriate ability [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md). The nature of your spell casting is determined by how you cast it. 
- Casting spells via the arcane uses [[Mythril](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md). 
- Casting from a [Patron](Spells/Patrons/Patron.md) requires the [Ability Score](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) associated with that [Patron](Spells/Patrons/Patron.md). 
- Casting from magic items pertains to the rules of that magic item. 
	- Scrolls and wands are generally treated the same as [Mythril](Mythril.md) casting. 

To successfully cast the spell, you must meet the [DC](../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) for that spell.
	Spell DCs are equal to 10 + that [Spell's Level](Spell%20Levels.md). 

On a failed check, the spell fizzles, any Mythril powder or other resource is still consumed.

On a critically failed check, a [Critical Miscast](../Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miscast.md) occurs.

If you fail a spell casting check, you may choose to succeed it instead, you lose [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) equal to the difference between the result of your roll and the spell's DC. If this reduces your FP to 0, you take the remaining difference to your [HP](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md), and then you gain the [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition.

Spellcasting requires ***two free hands*** for complex hand movements. You must speak an otherworldly incantation whose sound booms with arcane energy unless otherwise noted. Spell casting takes time, specified on the spell card under “Casting”.

Spellcasting that shoots projectiles at a a target do not require a [Ranged Attack](../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md) [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md), that is part of what the spellcasting check is doing. You still must have a clear line of sight to the target.

Remember the [Rule for rules](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md).
