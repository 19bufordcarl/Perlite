# Spell Memorization

A PC can only memorize the incantations for so many spells, the knowledge is fickle, complex and hard to retain. It takes a mental toll to remember spells for mages and casting spells can be a source of fatigue.

A PC can memorize spells equal to 2 times the PCs Intelligence stat.

A PC can scribe spells in a spell book if they choose and can choose to replace any spell they know with any spell they have the appropriate knowledge of. In this way a spell book can act as a kind of storage for any spells the PC comes across but does not have the mental space to memorize.

Spells can be swapped out from memory with a spell book over any long [[../Game Procedures/Resting\|Rest]].

| Intelligence | Max number of spells known |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| 1            | 2                          |
| 2            | 4                          |
| 3            | 6                          |
| 4            | 8                          |
| 5            | 10                         |
| 6            | 12                         |
| 7            | 14                         |
| 8            | 16                         |
| 9            | 18                         |
| 10           | 20                         |

Spells that are granted by a [[Spells/Patrons/Patron\|Patron]] do not count against your spell memorization total. 

###### Note
PCs do not automatically learn spells at level up, they must discover the spells in world. 

PCs can choose to start with spells equal to their [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] at [[../Character Creation/Character Creation Walkthrough|Character Creation]] by foregoing

The default setting has spell learning through [[../Referee Specific/Economy/Detailed Prices/Relevant Prices/Arcane Guild\|Arcane Guilds]] to aid in this.

*Optional Rule: Self Study*
*PCs learn 1 spell of a level less than or equal to their max spell level whenever they level up and increase their [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] (full [[../Game Procedures/Resting\|Rest]] required). In order to learn this spell, the PC must spend the amount of [[Mythril\|Mythril]] powder required for that spell to learn it through self study.*
