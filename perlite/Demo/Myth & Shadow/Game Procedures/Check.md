# Check

A check is made to resolve an uncertain situation with stakes.

A check is made by rolling a d20 and then add the relevant [Ability Score](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md).
	If your ability score is +2 or more, you may add your [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) to the check as well.

The check is successful if it beats the difficulty class ([DC](DC.md)) of the target.

The referee always sets the DC prior to the roll, and a player should be sure the referee has set the DC before the roll to preserve the integrity of the DC.

A result of 20 (natural 20) is a [Critical Success](../Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Success.md).

A result of 1 (natural 1) is a [Critical Failure](../Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Failure.md).

The reason 20 is a success and 1 is a failure means that the result is always uncertain. Accordingly the referee should only call for a check when the outcome is *uncertain*, otherwise, just resolve the PCs request and move on.

Reroll mechanics require you to use the new roll unless otherwise specified.
