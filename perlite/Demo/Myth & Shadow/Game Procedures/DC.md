# Difficulty Class

The Difficulty Class (DC) represents the number that needs to be rolled on a given [Check](Check.md) for it to be successful. 

A DC should rarely require a natural dice roll to be lower than 5 or higher than 18.

A simple rule of thumb that works well enough is 
- 5 is for easy checks, consider not rolling if failure doesnâ€™t make sense.
- 10 for normal checks
- 15 for hard checks
- 20 for extreme checks
- 25 is nearly impossible and should only be used for higher level activities
- 30 is too high, this can only really happen on a natural 20, consider not rolling.

Another rule of thumb that gives a bit tighter probability for checks is
- 9 for easy tasks
- 12 for normal tasks
- 15 for hard tasks
- 18 for extreme tasks

For things where there is no time pressure, I will often simply ask the player what their PCs relevant ability score is and decide if they can do the action based on that number rather than leave it to chance, unless randomness makes sense. This helps to protect niches from the "Barbarian remembers the historical account the wizard rolled to low for" issue.

*Author's Note:*
*While the referee can set any DC they want, it is important to remember they are not a computer and cannot take in all aspects of the situation. Perfect is the enemy of good enough. The main 3 DCs of 10, 15, 20 serve me well for almost all checks. I rarely stray from them.*
