# Resting

Resting is the main way PCs can recover damaged stats and heal conditions.

## Short Rest
A short rest is a period of 1 hour (10 delve [[Round\|Rounds]]) doing next to no movement or physical activity. After a short rest all [[../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Fatigue Points\|Fatigue Points]] are restored.
- During this time you cannot do heavy mental activity, such as [[../Magic/Spellcasting\|Spellcasting]] or [[../Magic/Alchemy/Alchemy\|Alchemy]].

### Interruption 
If a short rest is interrupted by [[Combat\|Combat]] or similar danger, consult the following table based on how many rounds have passed. If a PC fails the [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Constitution\|Constitution]] [[Check\|Check]], they must start the rest over.

| Rounds Spent Resting | Constitution Check DC to Continue Resting |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1-5                  | 20                                        |
| 6                    | 15                                        |
| 7                    | 15                                        |
| 8                    | 10                                        |
| 9                    | 10                                        |
## Long Rest
A long rest must be at least 8 hours long (2 [[Watches\|Watches]]) and consumes 1 ration. After a long rest, all [[../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Fatigue Points\|Fatigue Points]] are restored, [[../Conditions/Exhausted\|Exhaustion]] is cured, as are conditions that specify removal after a long, or full night of rest.
- You can split the rest into two pieces (at most 1 watch in between them) and still benefit.
- Long resting is necessary to avoid [[../Hazards/Biological\|Sleep Deprivation]].
- You can do heavy mental activity such as [[../Magic/Spellcasting\|Spellcasting]] or [[../Magic/Alchemy/Alchemy\|Alchemy]] for at most 1 hour.
### Interruption 
If a long rest is interrupted by [[Combat\|Combat]] or similar danger, the PCs still gain the benefits of the rest provided there was only one interruption and it was less than 1 hour long.

If there were multiple interruptions, or they lasted longer than 1 hour, a PC must succeed a [[DC\|DC]] 15 [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Constitution\|Constitution]] check. If they fail, they only receive the benefits of a short rest.

## Full Rest
A full rest is a full day (6 [[Watches\|Watches]]) spent primarily resting. A full rest confers all the benefits of a long rest. Additionally a full rest confers the following benefits.
- Restore 1 [[../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Health Points\|Health Point]].
- Restore any temporary ability damage (not [[../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Scars\|Scars]]).

Additionally, many [[../Conditions/All Conditions\|Conditions]] are healed / removed after a full rest.
	Temporarily damaged stats are usually healed after a full rest as well.

You can do heavy mental activity such as [[../Magic/Spellcasting\|Spellcasting]] or [[../Magic/Alchemy/Alchemy\|Alchemy]] for at most 1 hour this day.
### Interruption 
Each time a full rest is interrupted by [[Combat\|Combat]] or similar danger, a PC must make a DC 15 [[../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Constitution\|Constitution]] [[Check\|Check]] to receive the benefits of the rest. On a failed check they only receive the benefits of a long rest.

Word to the wise: donâ€™t count on full resting outside of civilization.
