# Resting

Resting is the main way PCs can recover damaged stats and heal conditions.

## Short Rest
A short rest is a period of 1 hour (10 delve [Rounds](Round.md)) doing next to no movement or physical activity. After a short rest all [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) are restored.
- During this time you cannot do heavy mental activity, such as [Spellcasting](../Magic/Spellcasting.md) or [Alchemy](../Magic/Alchemy/Alchemy.md).

### Interruption 
If a short rest is interrupted by [Combat](Combat.md) or similar danger, consult the following table based on how many rounds have passed. If a PC fails the [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) [Check](Check.md), they must start the rest over.

| Rounds Spent Resting | Constitution Check DC to Continue Resting |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1-5                  | 20                                        |
| 6                    | 15                                        |
| 7                    | 15                                        |
| 8                    | 10                                        |
| 9                    | 10                                        |
## Long Rest
A long rest must be at least 8 hours long (2 [Watches](Watches.md)) and consumes 1 ration. After a long rest, all [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) are restored, [Exhaustion](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) is cured, as are conditions that specify removal after a long, or full night of rest.
- You can split the rest into two pieces (at most 1 watch in between them) and still benefit.
- Long resting is necessary to avoid [Sleep Deprivation](../Hazards/Biological.md).
- You can do heavy mental activity such as [Spellcasting](../Magic/Spellcasting.md) or [Alchemy](../Magic/Alchemy/Alchemy.md) for at most 1 hour.
### Interruption 
If a long rest is interrupted by [Combat](Combat.md) or similar danger, the PCs still gain the benefits of the rest provided there was only one interruption and it was less than 1 hour long.

If there were multiple interruptions, or they lasted longer than 1 hour, a PC must succeed a [DC](DC.md) 15 [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) check. If they fail, they only receive the benefits of a short rest.

## Full Rest
A full rest is a full day (6 [Watches](Watches.md)) spent primarily resting. A full rest confers all the benefits of a long rest. Additionally a full rest confers the following benefits.
- Restore 1 [Health Point](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md).
- Restore any temporary ability damage (not [Scars](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md)).

Additionally, many [Conditions](../Conditions/All%20Conditions.md) are healed / removed after a full rest.
	Temporarily damaged stats are usually healed after a full rest as well.

You can do heavy mental activity such as [Spellcasting](../Magic/Spellcasting.md) or [Alchemy](../Magic/Alchemy/Alchemy.md) for at most 1 hour this day.
### Interruption 
Each time a full rest is interrupted by [Combat](Combat.md) or similar danger, a PC must make a DC 15 [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) [Check](Check.md) to receive the benefits of the rest. On a failed check they only receive the benefits of a long rest.

Word to the wise: donâ€™t count on full resting outside of civilization.
