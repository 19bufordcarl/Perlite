# Combat

When a fight breaks out, or seconds start to matter (collapsing cave), combat [[Round\|Rounds]] start.

First the referee determines if any creatures are surprised, meaning they were unaware of their attacker. Any surprised creatures skip their [[Turn\|Turns]] in the first [[Round\|Round]] of combat.

The referee then calls for [[Initiative\|Initiative]] rolls. Combat [[Round\|Rounds]] persist until the danger of combat is over, usually from surrender, fleeing, or death.
