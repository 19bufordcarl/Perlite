# Melee Attack

To make a melee attack, you make a [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Check](Check.md) and compare the result to the target's [Armor Class](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md), generally equal to the target's [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md). On a success, you roll damage die according to whatever [Weapon](../Items/Basic%20Equipment/Weapons.md) you used to make the attack, and add your [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) to get the final damage.

Melee attacks have a range of 5â€™ (adjacent square on a grid) unless stated otherwise.

Unarmed attacks such as Fists or Claws deal 1 + [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) damage unless otherwise noted.
