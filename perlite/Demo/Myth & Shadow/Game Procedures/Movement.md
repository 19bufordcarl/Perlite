# Movement

On a turn in combat, you can move up to your speed (default 30’). On a grid, each square is usually 5', so this would be 6 squares. In a measurement system 5ft would be 1in, so this would be 6 inches. Movement can be broken up into multiple pieces, like (move attack move).

Difficult movement costs double your movement resource. Examples include:
- Crawling
- Sneaking
- Wading
- Swimming
- Difficult Terrain
- Climbing

You can use 5 feet of movement to perform minor actions. The most used examples being:
- Drink a potion (max of 1 per [Round](Round.md))
- Stand up
- Open a door
- Lie down / Crouch
- Pull a lever
- Pick up an item
## Opportunity Attacks
If you are [Threatened](../Conditions/Threatened.md) by a creature, moving out of that creature’s threaten range allows that creature to use its [Reaction](Reaction.md) to make a [Melee Attack](Melee%20Attack.md) against you.
	These are called opportunity attacks.

You may sacrifice 15 feet of movement this turn to not provoke opportunity attacks.

## Enemy Creatures
You cannot move through a space occupied by another creature who is unwilling to let you pass. If that creature is [Incapacitated](../Conditions/Incapacitated.md) or [Prone](../Conditions/Prone.md) you may move through its space.

## Sizes
Creatures occupy a space equal to their size. Normal size is 1 square or 5 feet. For creatures 2 sizes larger than you, (3 squares or more for normal size) you can make a [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Check](Check.md) with a [DC](DC.md) equal to 10 + the creatures level to attempt to move through its space unharmed.

*Optional Rule: Variable Speed*
*PCs have a base move speed of 30 feet. 
Each point of [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) increases (or decreases) a PCs speed by 5’. 
Each point of strength a PCs worn [Armor](../Items/Basic%20Equipment/Armor.md) requires (not shields) decreases their speed by 5’.*

*Good for gamers who enjoy the nitty gritty of positioning tactics on battle maps.*
