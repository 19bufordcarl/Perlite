# Watches

A watch is four hours long. 

Most major [[Overland Journeys\|Overland Journey]] actions (travel, forage, etc.) take a watch to complete.

Watches are used in overland travel or when resting in a dangerous place.

Hex crawls are assumed to consist of 3 types of terrain.

| Type        | Time to traverse | Forage DC | Hunt DC |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------- | ------- |
| Normal      | 1 watch          | 10        | 15      |
| Difficult   | 2 watches        | 15        | 20      |
| Treacherous | 3 watches        | 20        | 25      |
A successful forage yields 1 ration.

A successful hunt yields rations equal to the class of animal.
