# What and Why are Artifacts

## What
Artifacts are powerful magic items that are an optional feature to use to enhance the build tactics of the base game. Items are a key element of this game. Without this rule there is a more hodgepodge feel to building out a character as the referee places items in dungeons over time. Artifacts give characters a consistent theme to build around from the start, similar to the function a class plays in 5e.

There is an index of [[Artifact Index\|Artifacts]] here.

As a PC levels up, they gain new understanding of how to use an artifact. Abilities are unlocked from an artifact according to the artifacts Tier progression. Each artifact spells out how to achieve the next tier, it is typically a combination of level and some other requirement.

You can also choose to use classes as defined from other RPG systems as artifacts, see details [[Classes as Artifacts\|here]].
## Why
This is inspired from Knave, which is a classless game. I enjoy classless games because the abstraction of bundling up a bunch of abilities into class levels and that being how you gain most of your power makes me feel like I am in a box. 

It also hurts my verisimilitude when multiclassing gets involved, but that's how mechanically interesting builds can happen.

And so I had an idea when watching [this Aestus_RPG video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBAptVH4Hl4). This idea comes from wanting to enforce the fantasy trope of the magic sword, book, ring, or item that begins the transformation from normal person to hero. Some artifacts were taken from this video [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-OsRuTrilIQEEagcAmi4bd5uTEyzIN15/edit).

We can attach the typical class abilities to an artifact that the players find. As they level up they unlock more abilities of this artifact throughout the campaign. This fits in well with knave's focus on items as how you define your character, while still having something similar to class abilities and progression.

It also makes creating your own "class" more natural as you can design a special item that will enable that class fantasy. Feel free to design your own, or base an item around an existing class in another RPG system. As long as it is tied to the artifact and all players are on the same page, the world will "balance" as stronger artifacts will draw stronger foes. That being said, keeping artifacts to a reasonable level is best.

For campaigns which have more experienced players, you can have the PCs discover these artifacts during the first session, or during character creation, similar to a class. It should be the players choice as the artifact will act similarly to how a class would work.

As a secondary note, at higher levels it is fine to have characters unlock the secrets and power within themselves, but the artifact is a nice way to make that progression feel more impactful than if the player gets the power to use and understand the magic right from the start.
