# The Necronomicon

### Description
*A dusty grimoire made of a weird, soft vellum. It is not calfskin. Perhaps, lamb? Its postscript warns that it was translated from the skulls of dead gods and that its translator, the man penning these very words, would take his own life for the vile greatness of it. A splash of blood on the margins suggests it was no vain threat.*

## Tier 0 Abilities
###### Unlock: Upon opening the book and attempting to read it.
The Necronomicon holds the secrets to arcane magic, each page is [[../../../../Magic/Spells/Mythril Spells/Spell Index\|Spell]]. This book's spells use [[../../../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] as their spell [[../../../../Magic/Spellcasting\|Casting]] ability. The event of the PC finding the book binds their destiny together, and whatever malevolent force is behind the book grants the PC knowledge of how to decipher 2 spells from it's pages. Deciphering the spells takes effort. Whenever your [[../../../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Intelligence\|Intelligence]] increases you may learn 2 more spells. 

The Necronomicon is a path to all sorts of knowledge, but it is limited by its nature. The spells in the Necronomicon cannot have the [[../../../../Magic/Spell Domains/Life\|Life]] [[../../../../Magic/Spell Domains/!Domain Index\|domain]]. (They can have ALL others).

The [[../../../../Magic/Spells/Levelled/Spell Level Index.md\|spell list]] is here. You gain a +1 to all spell [[../../../../Magic/Spellcasting\|Casting]] die rolls using this book.
