# The Enchiridion

### Description
*A dusty old tome made of a tough, almost bark like, binding. It's inscribed with the a zodiac of the elements, the forces of life and death, the sun, the moon, the stars, and the void. It is written in indecipherable glyphs but to the hero the text is as plain and clear as their childhood stories. The foreword states 'This is the Hero's Handbook. Remember always: The best life lived is a life lived for others.'*

## Tier 0 Abilities
###### Unlock: Upon opening the book and attempting to read it.
The Enchiridion holds the secrets to divine magic, each page is [Spell](../../../../Magic/Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Spell%20Index.md). This book's spells use [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) as their spell [Casting](../../../../Magic/Spellcasting.md) ability. The event of the PC finding the book binds their destiny together, and whatever benevolent force is behind the book grants the PC knowledge of how to decipher 2 spells from it's pages. Learning the spells requires your spirit to be disciplined and in line with the virtues extolled. Whenever your [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) increases you may learn 1 more spell. 

The Enchiridion is a path to all sorts of knowledge, but it is limited by its nature. The spells in the Enchiridion must have the [Life](../../../../Magic/Spell%20Domains/Life.md) [domain](../../../../Magic/Spell%20Domains/!Domain%20Index.md).

You can see the life [spell list](../../../../Magic/Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Spell%20Index.md) here. You gain a +1 to all spell [Casting](../../../../Magic/Spellcasting.md) die rolls using this book.
