# A Mythril Focus

### Description
*Thyrsus wood comes from an ancient growth tree. Perfect for staffs, wands, etc. Usually carved with adornments almost like ivy and leaves along the wood, and it looks like if you would only speak the right words it could flower and bear fruit. The wood feels connected to nature in a visceral way.*

## Tier 0 Abilities
###### Unlock: Upon touching the Thyrsus wood.
A Thyrsus lets the wielder connect to the energy of nature itself.

Choose a spell domain from among [Air](../../../Magic/Spell%20Domains/Air.md), [Earth](../../../Magic/Spell%20Domains/Earth.md), [Fire](../../../Magic/Spell%20Domains/Fire.md), and [Water](../../../Magic/Spell%20Domains/Water.md). You gain proficiency with that [Domain](../../../Magic/Spell%20Domains/!Domain%20Index.md) as well as the [Neutral](../../../Magic/Spell%20Domains/Neutral.md) domain from meditating with this focus. This focus' spells use [Wisdom](../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) as their spell [Casting](../../../Magic/Spellcasting.md) ability. The event of the PC touching the focus binds their destiny together, and the forces of nature itself grant the PC the ability to cast 2 spells with the focus. Learning the spells requires your spirit to be at peace with nature. Whenever your [Wisdom](../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) increases you may learn 1 more spell.

You can see the elemental [spell list](../../../Magic/Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Spell%20Index.md) here. You gain a +1 to all spell [Casting](../../../Magic/Spellcasting.md) die rolls using this focus.
