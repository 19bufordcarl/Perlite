# Classes as Artifacts

Optionally, you can use artifacts to give the class abilities from other RPG systems. Depending on their similarity to this system it may require more or less adaptation, but using the artifacts in this way can ground a character to the world in a tactile way. It also allows you to keep the fiction of a low magic world that is easier for the players to understand how to interact and not be told "actually that's not how magic works" Some recommendations for adaption are as follows.

## From 5e
- Anytime you would get +2 to an ability, change it to +1 since CDBRPG only uses the modifier
- Treat spell slots as number of spells learned instead
	- Prepared spell casters can still swap out their spells after a full rest
