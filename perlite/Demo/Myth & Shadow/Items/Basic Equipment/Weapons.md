*Throwing Knives Note:*

*Yes I am aware dagger / hatchets don't have the thrown property. You can absolutely throw them to try to hit something. It counts as an improvised [Ranged Attack](../../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md) weapon. The idea that throwing a knife / axe is a valid combat technique is pure fiction. I know this is a fantasy game, but this is the somewhat realistic part, not the magic part.*

*You want to throw your weapon? Use a javelin.*
