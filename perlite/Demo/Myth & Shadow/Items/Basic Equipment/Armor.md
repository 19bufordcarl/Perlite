# Armor

Armor reduces the amount of damage taken from [Slashing](../../Damage%20Types/Slashing.md), [Piercing](../../Damage%20Types/Piercing.md), and [Bludgeoning](../../Damage%20Types/Bludgeoning.md) by the armor's damage reduction value. 

**Worn armor does not take up any [Item Slots](../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slots.md).**

If an armor is heavy, the wearer has [Disadvantage](../../Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) on all [Dexterity](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md), and sinks in water.
	The wearer can make a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 20 [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) every 6 second [Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md) to not sink.

## Ability Requirements
If you do not meet the minimum [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) requirement, you have [Disadvantage](../../Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) on all [Checks](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md), and your [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md) speed is decreased by 15’.

If you do not meet the minimum [Constitution](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) requirement, you gain the [Exhausted](../../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition after wearing the armor for 6 minutes (1 delve [Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md)).
## Shields
| Shield Type    | Constitution | Strength | Slots | Price |
| -------------- | ------------ | -------- | ----- | ----- |
| Shield         | 1            | 1        | 1     | 50    |
| Mythril Shield | 1            | 0        | 1     | 200   |
#### Shield Block
Shields require one free hand to wield. Shields grant the wielder a [Reaction](../../Game%20Procedures/Reaction.md) to attempt to block an incoming attack that deals [Bludgeoning](../../Damage%20Types/Bludgeoning.md), [Piercing](../../Damage%20Types/Piercing.md), or [Slashing](../../Damage%20Types/Slashing.md) damage after the attack [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md). To block an incoming attack, the shield bearer makes a [Strength](../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) with a [DC](../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) equal to the target's attack [Check](../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md). On a successful block, the bearer reduces the damage taken by an additional 5. On a failure, damage proceeds as normal. (Reactions can only be used once per [Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md)).
## Don / Doff
Normal Armor takes 1 minute (10 combat [Rounds](../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md)) to don / doff.

Heavy Armor takes 6 minutes (1 delve [Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md)) to don / doff.

Shields are treated as normal items, (dropped freely and picked up with 5’ of [Movement](../../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md)).
