# Armor

Armor reduces the amount of damage taken from [[../../Damage Types/Slashing\|Slashing]], [[../../Damage Types/Piercing\|Piercing]], and [[../../Damage Types/Bludgeoning\|Bludgeoning]] by the armor's damage reduction value. 

**Worn armor does not take up any [[../../Player Characters/Derived Statistics/Item Slots\|Item Slots]].**

If an armor is heavy, the wearer has [[../../Dice Rolls/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] on all [[../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Dexterity\|Dexterity]] [[../../Game Procedures/Check\|Checks]], and sinks in water.
	The wearer can make a [[../../Game Procedures/DC\|DC]] 20 [[../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Strength\|Strength]] [[../../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]] every 6 second [[../../Game Procedures/Round\|Round]] to not sink.

## Ability Requirements
If you do not meet the minimum [[../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Strength\|Strength]] requirement, you have [[../../Dice Rolls/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] on all [[../../Game Procedures/Check\|Checks]], and your [[../../Game Procedures/Movement\|Movement]] speed is decreased by 15’.

If you do not meet the minimum [[../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Constitution\|Constitution]] requirement, you gain the [[../../Conditions/Exhausted\|Exhausted]] condition after wearing the armor for 6 minutes (1 delve [[../../Game Procedures/Round\|Round]]).
## Shields
| Shield Type    | Constitution | Strength | Slots | Price |
| -------------- | ------------ | -------- | ----- | ----- |
| Shield         | 1            | 1        | 1     | 50    |
| Mythril Shield | 1            | 0        | 1     | 200   |
#### Shield Block
Shields require one free hand to wield. Shields grant the wielder a [[../../Game Procedures/Reaction\|Reaction]] to attempt to block an incoming attack that deals [[../../Damage Types/Bludgeoning\|Bludgeoning]], [[../../Damage Types/Piercing\|Piercing]], or [[../../Damage Types/Slashing\|Slashing]] damage after the attack [[../../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]]. To block an incoming attack, the shield bearer makes a [[../../Player Characters/Chosen Statistics/Strength\|Strength]] [[../../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]] with a [[../../Game Procedures/DC\|DC]] equal to the target's attack [[../../Game Procedures/Check\|Check]]. On a successful block, the bearer reduces the damage taken by an additional 5. On a failure, damage proceeds as normal. (Reactions can only be used once per [[../../Game Procedures/Round\|Round]]).
## Don / Doff
Normal Armor takes 1 minute (10 combat [[../../Game Procedures/Round\|Rounds]]) to don / doff.

Heavy Armor takes 6 minutes (1 delve [[../../Game Procedures/Round\|Round]]) to don / doff.

Shields are treated as normal items, (dropped freely and picked up with 5’ of [[../../Game Procedures/Movement\|Movement]]).
